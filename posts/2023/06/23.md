Title: PLUS TWO
  
∆559 :: de **quatro** de um time meh :: almost one hundred can't imagine the taxman share :: called about the possibility of taking over the enterprise architect role :: then brekkie before run :: not many cars out but quite a lot of runners :: omelette as **equinox** plus two lunch :: skipz willys but gets to elmtoft™ for the **näkkude** :: pitstop at jämjö for snacks and other food stuffs :: very tired drive to mörbylånga :: where lunch was served and **dutifully** eaten :: divorcees on tinder find themselves ::cyclez too the pier where a **catamaran** has burnt down :: then the food orgy continues with drinks and josé cuervo :: the singer from the grand minnows and the **reverberation** of an empty pool :: s'mores on the pizza oven while slumbering with life coach on the porch sofa
