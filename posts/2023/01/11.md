Title: PIC BLANC
  
∆735 :: not exactly an early start :: the tribulations of trying to find the right ticket combination with helpp from laura the **frijolera** :: a few blue runs to warm up then down came the fog :: just as we went up to pic blanc :: rendez vous @pulka but lunch at the grau roig hotel :: which was **lyxigt** but nothing special taste-wise :: the other side of the mountain as the fog lights :: then a very long run down that takes us to where we didn’t need to be :: realizes that there are no **piste** numbers on the map :: so one has to use the old method of asking :: and it was in the complete opposite direction of what the internal compass pointed at :: despite tired legs a good black run down to the parking :: no time to rest as la vella must be explores :: yakitori **yakimeshi** sake hot because no spaniard would eat before twenty hundred :: and so apparently mercury is retrograding
