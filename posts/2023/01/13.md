Title: LA COMA
  
âˆ†801 :: as per **sovmorgon** agreement :: nothing out of the ordinary @cosmos brekkie fashion-wise  :: the tunnel that takes us to the north side :: not many slopes but reasonably good snow and no lift queues :: then fast-food at the den of frijoleras :: a bit of alpine feeling resting on the sun before the afternoon schedule :: which was slightly slushy and very tiring for the non endurance athletes ::  there is a **laundromat** across from cosmos showing the spanish version of who wants to be a millionaire :: by car to **biz cochuelo** i avui i ho saps :: and it was shite despite yucca :: late night parking drama but no harm done :: steam monad **liman**
