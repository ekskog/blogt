Title: NINETY FOUR  
  
∆342 ∆452 ∆514 :: even the tv show host got kicked :: pear and **eddelflower** induced nausea :: pitstop at the gas station for a ridiculously overprice can of coke :: front row with the elite :: stick to the instructions and get ninety four :: then again listen to the instructions when bricking :: kings also need a fair share of luck :: a **streetwise**, cynical hipster :: no from the telco in town :: true scotsman fallacy :: no connection to the house but rather well with the group :: recruiters that should have been **supermodels** :: node can’t find the hexagon’s hat but python can :: so askz the _ayaye_ to write a quick app for that :: then someone @metso calls all the way @suomi :: and stillhaz timee to prepare a rather delicious greek dinner before she leaves for pe.one :: utterly depressing finnish crime drama
