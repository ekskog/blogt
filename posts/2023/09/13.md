∆334 ∆704 :: thought it felt like being **awake** the whole night : in the green :: out towards @furesø : and the trail was **technically** very hard : and the directions were no especially good :: indirectly to carlsberg® by : on account of a train **terminating** at the central station :: a very swift and fast final separation from the consulting house : no longer a mac® owner :: gets a power adapter : which will end up as landfill :: plant based hamburger : and some falafel : while talking about curry and bangladesh's **peaceful** relationship to india :: **matcha** is actually able to do what tororojo® does : without much of the negative aspects :: ask the chatbot to compare **enterprise** to it solution : and gets an answer that is pretty good : and confirms that we are not running an _eeay_ practice over here :: so wingmen® is unknown to the evil search engine :: then a walk around two blocks with a break for ice cream :: instead of intro week : which would probably be  **apocryphal** :: dan™ is the man :: rendesvouz with elnono™ outside magasin du nord : who brought an umbrella : **conveniently** :: two poor choices of burger joints : so bøv® it is instead : for uruguayan prime cuts : and crème brulle : and of course stories ::arrivez too a very dark and sound asleep residence
