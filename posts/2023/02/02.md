Title: CRISP AND COLD
  
∆641 :: **situational** fluency and insightful listening despite february not being january :: all a big mess @vevey and that presents itself as an opening for swimming :: intervals with **equipment** and still humiliated :: when everything seems to be crumbling down run to kvien™voll :: all sorts of tribulations with **mariner** so blame delftie™ :: only no blame is needed it is **hallogallo** :: but when it finally gets installed and filled with the needed packages it is good :: so one can do the **karfiol** on the air fryer in peace and so the door is closed :: strangely with plenty energy on the legs :: paint guilt shire **shirk** :: targum onkelos  **obnubilated**
