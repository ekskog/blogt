Title: THE ORCHESTRA
  
Δ637 :: after freaking out from a cocktail of toro® with ipren® :: three brekkie **burritos** : and super light packing :: plans for two tates :: of course one could leave the bike outside @lergravsparken :: chargez phones courtesy of joe-juice® :: no frills boarding :: alight @purley for velipulai™ and nagasothy™ :: thentakez thee tube to the house of llama™ skies :: room sevenª for blake™ : hell but no winter :: **gouache** or body color : on blue paper :: paper money being not legally tendered at the store : donateza babybird :: a long walk along the thames : the weather being kind and so : stay north until golden **jubilee** bridge :: the south bank is rather nice these days :: but @tate-modern is weird :: a failed attempt to visit the national library : on account of no **eastbound** central line from @blackfriars :: so it is early to the hall : no posters just a lousy t-shirt :: second row a bit too off center : but just behind thurston™ :: the orchestra was young : but entirely qualified :: no photographs allowed :: and it was more than just the ship : which was a nice surprise :: until the encore when sal-de-frutas™ managed to upset the **israelis** on the audience :: a very **agreeable** and fast return to @horley : which is by no means @london proper
