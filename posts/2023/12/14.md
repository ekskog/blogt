Title: AXES OF EVIL
  
∆412 ∆720 : much needed **stoppage** time :: extra layer on account of the wind : then it was very sweaty :: the _veedee_ wears helmets : and is over friendly :: cocobox® k3s® nodes are **pretty dead** : and so also is hbvu.su :: guess "today" is a sliding window in time :: totally aligned with the triumvirat#5™ : then salg® : **cybernetics** : kubernetes :: bookza **vandrarhem** for vasaloppet® :: the msft® folks turn up late : on account of parking :: there was cake and it was gluten free : maybe :: tramp : joule : **would** :: and so the last workshop was done : **segued** into the committee : and it was good :: out to nyhavn_six : but no one is in : persistzand getzin :: instructz the teens on how to effectively do the move :: lesson learned - ikea® stuff can only be **assembled** once :: spends thirty looking for the bed hardware : no luck so move boxes to make room for beds :: then create a clear passage to the loo : there is no delivery of any food within the hour : so fixie® and left overs :: it seemed empty @beta : but it was actually a good crowd :: and so the supposed opening act was the guitarist on the main event : and it was loud and it was cathartic : a **phatic** communion
