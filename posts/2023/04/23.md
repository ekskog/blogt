Title: BAKED
  
∆611 :: sick : thick : slick  :: with **proboscides** :: thick : grain : penis : unpin : **unzip** :: out with señor™felix who doesn’t want to go far in the rain :: there is a record store @bagsværd but it was closed :: ripe orange by the kerb :: doez the kebabs :: **d͡ʑɛrˈʐɨj̃skʲi** ::eatz tooo much listening to **gafieira** until the game starts :: first half then road :: but first agrees with plast™godson on record day purchases :: the combination of e22 and a game at **beira-rio** leads inevitably to a defeat at the last minute
