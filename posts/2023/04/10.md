Title: FIRE
  
∆658 :: namamu namaku :: clair poser **under** :: unhappy with plumbing :: the **symbolism** of the color red :: movezalbums from onedrive to cocobox :: considerz fixing the lawn butsettlez forr a fire :: which needs **tending** and feeding :: but first doritos to break the fasting :: all debts with most beloved paid :: this is how you lose the time war :: the garden **reject** will take care of itself given enough time :: an easier way to download from youtube :: more murder at the picnic and still **below eighty** :: ten percent more abs :: a bump the size of a **sugar molecule** :: the decay of the **kaon** particle :: trombone drones that feel like **aumākua**
