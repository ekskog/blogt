Title: RUFFLED
  
∆624 :: store swamp slain **snă-foo͞′** :: the military as a source of neologisms :: historical clown car of a company :: below the same yellow silk jacket trimmed in ermine :: not able to sketch a workable blueprint for utopia :: which is what the **hoi″ pə-loi′** really wanted :: from the ice age to the dole age : from intro to some girls : five hundred done :: gotta drive #2™ @bergåsa on account of sold out trains :: so early lunch but decidez to finish assembly of **godmorgon** :: a half mara with a chest heart rate gives much better pace :: but the pool didn't get warm enough :: the legs responded well :: a very good game  @anfield **acquiesced** by mamão™ :: otherwise it is just waiting for the game :: and since it is easter sunday : a chocolate is what we got
