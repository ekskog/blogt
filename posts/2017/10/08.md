Title: IN-RAINBOWED 
  
make cordova work then do the blueberry oats thing. fix the kitchen an put legs on the bed. swim longer than ever and get cramps on the last turn. run, or rather jog for twenty cays then be refuse a table on the pizzeria on account of the handball. do take away, then fix the blinds. get slightly breathless and very very thirsty. get a proper dlms app on the one plus. consider re-evaluating friendship with boosaardigâ„¢ based on his comments on br2049.
