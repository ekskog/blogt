Title: JOAB JOAB
  
feel the start of the dark period, turn on the lights early, wait for mandy™ to wake up then oats. coach duq™ on all things thing. consider doing the peppster session but decide to continue coding instead. empty the leftovers tupperwares and get to the road. drive pretty fast and get stopped by the super hot police girl, who knew little about colors on back light indicators and fortunately didn’t have a speed gun. meet the chico™lainen at the hotel and collect the bike bag. make a u-turn and drive straight back. put running shoes and do a session on the construction site. jump in the jacuzzi, do fish in a small container in the oven. judge the comics by the cover and get disappointed with the poor art inside.
