Title: ROSE OF VICTORY
  
the opposite of speed :: kick start by re-installing with rasmus™. cab delftie™ to kallinge then to akalla for electricity and telco. meetup with håfors™ and instantly get busy, pause for lunch with abhas™ and debate the pros and cons of pakistani family values in the modern swedish family economics. wrap it up and delegate delftie™ the provisioning workflow. start the fast learning process while in the lounge. invite boosaardig™ for an evening with icelanders and get the raincheck. make it on time via the metro in time for a fine tee and get puzzled with the 30 minutes plus intermission. leave as agreed and rendez-vous for a pub crawl between waterlooplein and damplatz.
