Title: EPIC (ISH)
  
get a free pass for a long day. be unprepared and undecided about how to execute a non existing plan and as a result forget gloves, phone and extra underwear, solve the glove problem at shell. muck about thinking about where to park and park well before meeting finne™. do very well and even wait sometimes. swim ok and get bibi-kudos. make way to the old football arena and run around it in a on-off pretty good pace. refuel scottishily and meet the teuto™finns. arrange for a rendezvous with mauritian rum.
