make use of the alarm for the first time in eons. have brekkie with budyk™ dressed like jimmy page. cab to the waterfall and explain the extrovert façade concept. educate the historians and get screwed by lack of local administrative rights. get liked anyway. make it to @hbvu and entertain tyngsrider™ and laugh about racist rectors.
