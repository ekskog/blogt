Title: CEMENT
  
drive like it was night, still traumatized and therefore under or at the speed limit. get slightly panicked with a crashed android but arrive at the plant early and go in and out figuring out the parking layout. have a blast with the german and danes then go to the office to learn from the coder™. get a coke to help stay awake and barely make it. cycle alright-ish and get rewarded with vindaloo. open up procedures for the boosardig™ recommendation
**an audio book:** foreword - mogoliad (stephenson)  
**[ [a song](https://dark-sky.bandcamp.com/track) ]:** finding home (dark skies)
