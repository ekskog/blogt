Title: HACK THE GRID
  
club lounge, no o.j. hitch with budykâ„¢, who can find a car in a large parking lot without sweat. snitch two iot kits, sit on the back and hack the meter. joylessly. join the innovators, teach them all. exit earlier. recharge while delayed. run and catch the last train in eight minutes from gate to door. sit opposite a king lizard sipping thai beers. hitch the somali cab driver.
