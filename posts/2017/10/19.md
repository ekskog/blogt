Title: PLUGATHON
  
no bike before brekkie then club lounge, which was crap but empty and quiet. meet abhas™ who is metamorphing into a mullah. cab deluxe to the energy. wait for budyk™ then go educate the hackers. have all sorts of hiccups and still shine. bike instead of code meters then do a bloc run at the treadmill. walk to the surinamean crossover shithole. walk back and see the other two to sleep. get a box of matches and struggle against the wind to light the prefab bob. walk around the block taking out of focus pictures, consider a tony but get o.j. instead.
