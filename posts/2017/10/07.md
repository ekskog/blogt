Title: DECKARD K
  
go shopping early, not hungry, get screws for bed legs, go back to jquery, fix it proper, ignore turkdrummer™. make plans for 2049, acquire good seats. get on the q.roo, mindset for 60 cay. start well, warm clothes, then get foken soaked @calmare_län and precatiously cut down to a hundred. get burnt calves never-the-less. fight over not enough hot water in boiler and eat proper. get in time for some cider with mozarella sticks then ads, then learn how to baseline on “cells interlinked within cells interlinked within one stem” by nabokov (?!). get jawdropped at every scene.
