Title: ADAMUM  
  
a day off that not really worked out because of **subcontinental** information technologists and danish tesla drivers (i would enjoy employment as a **wallpaper** professional fitter). then a decent bike ride despite the **headwind** and the chilled weather when the sun retired. which drains one’s **glycogen** which gets replenished with pizza, while watching eurosport. because watching the star wars freak show is more than i can **stomach**.  
**a movie:** rogue one  
**[ [a song:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9hSCx_xmGo) ]** all that we perceive (thievery corporation)
