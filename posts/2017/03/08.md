Title: FINGERS BURNT
  
the way to the station would have been made more comfy with the addition of an **umbrella**. rendez-vousing with art and getting tips on **self-promotion.** then at den bosch making a slight mistake around deep learning but still shining and producing value for the **shareholder**. talking to remko we agree, **epiphanically**, that the bigger risk is not an ay-eye apocalypse, but the lost of humanity to algorithms.  
skipping the gym again on the interest of ticking elvis from the **bucket list** which was very satisfactory despite the fact that the most important song on the **repetòire** was left out. following the discussion of cheating forward a miracle has the same value, i settle for **unresolved**, luisito.
**a book:** the undoing project (michael lewis)  
**a song:** oliver’s army (elvis costello)
