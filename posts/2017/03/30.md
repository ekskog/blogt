Title: DOODLE  
  
a rainy jammed highway as the **scenery** for ragnarök. naturally. then eat a second, **unsubsidized** breakfast. and get irritated at **people** trying to talk about things they don’t know. and revert to whiteboarding after a **pregnancy** hiatus. then drive back on even more **grey weather**. learn about the **babel tower** and yah-wey**.** run intervals on the aquarium **barefeet** and ruin the left toes too. watch daja **decay**.  
**a book:** stories of your life and others (ted chiang)  
**[ [a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV0DSgruVH8) ]:** psalm 23 (jessi colter)
