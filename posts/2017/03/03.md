Title: BUMMING IN AN AIRPORT  
  
**outdoors** is so much easier, i guess everyone is right when they say that running is a mental activity not a physical one. then a really **ridiculously** superb breakfast at the house the paris inherited soundtracked by twelve string guitars and moog solos played by angels. it started to rain while i snapped iron manholes then a quick detour to find perhaps a new **human** i can agree with before getting the long but faster and more **lucrative** way home. which ended up in back pain and the **same old fight** that is getting too old to be ignored.  
**a song:** from the beginning (elp)
