Title: A BETTER ROUTE  
  
donated two rusty drachmas to the red cross as payment for two books in swedish, considering that i had left my paper white outside the traveling timbuktu. had some more surrealistic moments of presenting to the totally uninterested before visiting a lab where pretentiousness grows in petri dishes and macbooks. checked in to a handicapped room with a super soft madrass then escaped down to some real treadmill torture.  
**a book:** fasanj√§garen
