Title: CISSA 13  
  
**forfeit** a super expensive breakfast and trade for seeds and pineapple flavored coconut water. show up at the office without any of the **tools of the trade**. then borrow a few from the folks at the fourth floor while waiting for the **consultants**. get confirmation on the **delivery** of the in-room coffee machine. and superbly have the **corporation** pass the receipt confirming you were right all along. and so what? take the **opportunity** to exit stage left and head to the history lesson delivered on battered toes by the might white rabbit then continue **barefoot** the last yards to fish heaven. while gazing a **ridiculously** gorgeous sunset on the beach. proceed to hoard **stickers** and get a second, entirely free lesson on the logic of the **five plants** and discovered a new favorite. get assurance that all you post is **rubbish** and pay back with trash euro disco for extra insult.Â
