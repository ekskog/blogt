Title: THE PRISON WALLS  
  
on a **rampage** to catch up with knowledge before deadlines. then **procrastinate**. identities and bad weather and **excuses** to stay in. get acquainted with yet another **bizarre** reorg but at least this time the nemesis of gunnar gets the boot where it best fits. and then some super sad news about the **circle of life** catching up with the burger muncher. is there a dog heaven or this **rawest** of the deals is all there ever was? which makes night swimming and streetart even more deserving of **quiet nights**.Â
