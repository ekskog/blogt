Title: A HOMELY RESTAURANT  
  
note to self: <strike>don’t go **dnd**</strike> the night before a red eye, there is a chance one can receive a **cancellation** text from the airline which can keep one from waking up too early. use the extra time for a totally ridiculously **awful** ten cay then get selected for a “**random**” explosive residues test on the airport for the 14th consecutive time. make everyone at IT **confused** and still come home without the tools of the trade, **corporate** sponsored.  
catch some swedish **traditional** food for lunch, steal a flapjack then discovered how overweight one gets once one becomes head of a sw consulting business.
