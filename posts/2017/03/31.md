Title: CALVIN  
  
struggle to focus but at least get two **vouchers** for the price of one. proceed to **carboload** on cheese and pepperoni and go all the way. **struggle** a bit more with counter-intuitive sales tools and take the blame, then find something that you really like and move forward. break for one hour and try, with success, to fill it with more than twenty five cays. **embarrass** teens and make the way to the movie theater, which in my **formative** years were huge rooms and now have about five half filled rows.  
**a movie**: life (spinoza)Â  
**[ [an album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFm5H52NZiU) ]**: blue (yoko kanno & seatbelts)
