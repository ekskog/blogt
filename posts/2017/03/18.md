Title: ROLLED OVER  
  
emptied the hof and went north to **heartbreakingly** wave goodbyes. then wondered in the rain for **eleven** cay killing time before boarding. chose tyrolean grub for lunch and it was **unhealthily** delish. acknowledged wolfgang and franzunaware of chuck taking **a few** last breaths. then rode shotgun while **streaming** a pretty dumb soccer match.Â  
**a song:** roll over beethoven (chuck berry)
