Title: SNOOKER AND T2
  
enter through the **back door**. start climbing the gold **loyalty** ladder. do the usual quick turn at schiphol then **haag**. asphalt with the rabbit then **seafood** then herbalize a visit to the movie theater. make a pit stop and watch **snooker** at the coffee shop. act **weirdly** on social media. **misappropriate** merkelâ€™s head as an avatar. have a real trainspotting **dialogue** with said rabbit and remember nothing afterwards.
**a movie:** trainspotting 2 (rent, spud, sick boy, begbie)  
**[ [a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlMDRBB-O5M) ]**: last kiss (minus the bear)
