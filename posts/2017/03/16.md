Title: STITCHED  
  
on a bus, packed like **sardines**, going uphill to a magic mountain resort, which could have been an annex to sweden if only they served meatballs instead of schnitzel. a fairly **mediocre** pair of runs in a slope crowded with noobs crowned with a half vault. then feeding from the **offspring** and putting the lesson to practice caused a major improvement. filling polls for the man with much **consideration** for truth. then sauna then gluttony then german **pop** radio.Â  
**a song:** onnanoko (schneider tm vs kpt. michi.gan)
