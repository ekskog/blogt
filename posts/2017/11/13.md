Title: PETROL
  
you may find yourself in the wrong hotel, eating proper oats. find time to sample streetart before jumping on the norwegian-afghan express to big oil. have an escorted visit to the john then dominate lo habitual. exchange ironman impressions with espen™ then finish early. manage to catch an earlier departure and get a window seat for optimal fjord observation. sleep. get a yung lin beverage to #2™ then sit opposite what looked like serbian shaved thugs.
