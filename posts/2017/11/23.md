Title: AIRBAG    
  
tired, rain no laptop power. taxi. get wrong directions from the reception but meet the customers. give a lot of time to exâ„¢gbb and regret. tie up with the ferry company then exit stage left to a super crowded airport. enter express kundalini and consider not using the seatbelt. decide never again to have such a stupid thought as bambi jumps in front of abdullah and fire the airbags.
