Title: CWS DOT CH
  
too tired to workout or do anything else but catch lounge eggs and bacon. arrive too early and tell the panama story to ex™hotbox. spend the afternoon with the hw magicians, an ukranian and an idiot. realize zurich is pretty lame when it comes to cast iron. walk to a pretty boring town to a pretty lame french restaurant. refuse to talk shop. top up in the lounge and struggle to fix bad code.
