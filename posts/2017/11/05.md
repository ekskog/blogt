Title: THE DAY AFTER
  
sleep as bad as it is possible. brain cleared of task. surprisingly easy to eat and relive the day before. shop for refilled glory then bake under the sun for the ceremony. head to the pineapple at the pier and get pina coladas with refills. manage to walk normally to the car despite the bike shoe sore. try to sleep but sunbathe instead. walk the long walk to the texan grill house for surf and turf and a huge mangorita.
