Title: NINJA DINNER
  
wake up and realize all the snow has melted. take the train and greet partners in a big aula. watch exâ„¢gbb steal time with repeated bad taste jokes about aluminum rain. meet all the others and get bored. cab to a michelin place with shite food. hitch the ladies 300 meters on account of rain.
