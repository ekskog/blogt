Title: INSULIN
  
fail on the edge mostly then drive to the insulin factory where two fat men were sawing a pine tree with intentions to kickstart juletid. set expectations then kick ass. get educated on the crackling pigskin on the julbord. return the laptop get cider then get a trip back from 14 to 9 with enpeear. get oitenta twelve imprinted in the brain for whatever reason and we become a macabre algorithm. evade the chaos @solversborg with waxed.
