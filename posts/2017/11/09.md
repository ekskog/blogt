Title: TWENTY
  
lose the 6 atlantic crossing hours. arrive fresh, get the luggage fast and skip customs. go right when the bus was by the left door. escape the parking lot without a qr code. drive half way then pass the wheel to #mandy. pick the i20 and forfeit the supermarket. try to sleep and fail. speak to #one and feel all the emptiness he has left behind. reminisce of his arrival. try to get the boiler to boil. connect a pen to a tablet, dont get too impressed. it eas the cure who believed in the evolved packet core but were constantly threatened by duran duran arguments to keep quiet. america has no shelf room for last year’s model, as once advised by the earl of skogås.
