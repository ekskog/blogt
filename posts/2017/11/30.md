Title: BRAG
  
wet weather makes cycling with felt more reliable but still super bad. struggle against the wind towards a session with fr√∂. spend three times more than desired. discard the garmin activity. mobilismize scifi and sweat on edge. getting nothing done really then blame the wifi signal, swap desks then move to mr robot. which is getting a pretty lame third season.
