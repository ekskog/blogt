Title: AT THE VENUE
  
**east to northwest >>** wake up in effelay but do it early and skip brekkie. push hard with the chicos towards the panhandle but one hour behind the real ironfolks. get acquainted with backpacker. spend a lot of time in amazon and buy things one doesnâ€™t really nneds like a new gps clock, a voice home controller and a big home theatre system. make it in good time and stop at the chowtime for some good food poisoning. catch with the others and go for a swim with the stingrays and the portuguese manowars. cross the street for dinner with the bikers.
