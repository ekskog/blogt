Title: TURNPIKE TO CAVALIER
  
get the first sleep proper interrupted by the alarm. tetris part one. surprise #waffle_house_monica by not ordering enough brekkie meat. miss a great opportunity to get a second ammendment t-shirt for boosaardigâ„¢. move to the back seat until lunch. get frugal and limp to texaco @ocala but find the opportunity was gone. find out that there is no booze for sale on the gas stations of the turnpike. check into the art deco hotel and convince the pack that in miami one eats cuban, not burgers. extend into an extra visit to the bucket margaritas with the chicos.
