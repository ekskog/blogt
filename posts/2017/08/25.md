Title: THE DAY BEFORE
  
**{ 164703631928 }**  
do the one-to-one in style at the hilton. skip lounging and try to find tony’s for chicas. failed then get some other random dutch chocolate. transit effortlessly with a pitstop for potato salad and smoked salmon at the wrong terminal then continue to gbg. load dyclofenac on request and start towards the island. stop for a dishwasher and make it in time to purchase garments at the tent. get briefed then thai as carbo-loading. meet the chicas then bed.
