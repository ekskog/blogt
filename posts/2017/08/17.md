open eye, check soccer result. get hopeful, watch the highlights. pack the fx35 with trash then change minds about the pool, then go open water because of the sun. struggle with foggy goggles but go longer than ever. wave to the boatman parking at the beach. cycle on the old bike. do a lot of docker discovery. discover tears on the neoprene, order cement, twice. cook brasilian potatoes with spaninsh sausages and mi™s cabbage to make a teutonic dinner to be eaten outdoors, in what could be the last day of summer. drive #1™ to the same party as #2™ and act taxi driver at one pm.
