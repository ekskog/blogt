Title: DICTATORS LIKE US
  
**{ 164705853608 }**  
consider more procrastination, decide to start but make it false by redirecting to bandcamp. arrange things around, remove the fat and keep only the cream. inform neumann™. consult with budyk™ and surf around for pictures and text, build a patch blanket, upload and alea jacta est, c'est jest. fiddle around with swags and get totally unconvinced. watch the under twenties lose the second silverware in a row at the shoot-outs. go out for the last session before eleven dot three, go the kenyan way, only slower. pack all in an orange roller board. retire.
