Title: SUMMER PROPER AT THE GAS STATION
  
**{ 164032182278 }**  
add clouberrys for extra carb, pack it all in the small i20. meet the pee™tee at the gas station. make pit stops for adjustments and feed ammonia to lingonberries. push hard on intervals then continue through the most beautiful day. feel surprisingly little on the quads. refuel with scottish. bum around for most of the day then pizza with she™walker then the usual fight
