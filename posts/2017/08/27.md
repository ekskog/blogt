Title: A DIFFERENT TRACK
  
**{ 164703048973 }**  
be up at five, in disbelief. pass the time with rand and meachum then go down, and see that the chicos were also awakening. pack with style. cook too much oats and crush too little watermelon. bide time doing nothing then kiss the precious ones so-long. get hitched on a charger then steal an audio book to alleviate the boredom of the west to southeast chatanoogaa. get to the drop off station in time for the big rains and find refuge looking for mats and very expensive chairs. raise the c in the hot tub, prepare tacos and get a ton of shit for nothing new. do someone else’s job and watch a comfortable win.
**a (audio) book:** dark matter (blake crouch)
