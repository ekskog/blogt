Title: THE DUTCH GRID
  
**{ 164852917788 }**  
do the shaker thing then drive in silence to take the later faqir. arrive under rain but notice no delays. more rain at the beckis asylum so a taxi cab is required. use the extra time to purchase more raw bars at the mall then go face the power company. outsmart everyone and teach them buggers about billing. get loved and awed at. grace oneself with another cab to an earlier rendezvous with herc at the falafels. acquire gifts then off to the office in the projects waste time. get really really frightened of bosaardig clowns, miss the bus to traffic then decide to make the time on another cab for third time extra luck. send the gift as special luggage and get delayed by the thickest fog.
