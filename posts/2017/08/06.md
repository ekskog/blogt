Title: THE APPRENTICE
  
**{ 163977392713 }**  
white balled like the country club which always counts as work out. get groceries and spend the same ammount as always despite the promise to only get bread and milk. then out for a two hour spin, completely destroyed by the last two cays of gusting winds. consider topping it up with a ring island spin but get to the jacuzzi instead. start optmistically about the game but soon realise it was all an attempt to sabotage the whole season. get the rest of the day ruined, monitoring the social channels for an eventual removal of the vp and his apprentice.
