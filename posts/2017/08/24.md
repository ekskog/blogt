Title: A ROOF
  
**{ 164676970238 }**  
get on the faqir, by cabonline, at an exhorbitant fare. get onboard first and find a suitable place for the rollerbag. transit with enought time for brekkie at the lounge. pack glossies for mand¥™. circle a'dam three times then land late. make it before andy2™ and make acquaintance with the other pj-ninjas. get bothered by how all the narratives were similar, all pj-ninjas have people-loving skillzlike bollocks. dread the show but make a very good one indeed, control the canteen conversations. go thorugh the afternoon motions effortlessly then check in and dinner at paris' house in schiphol. discuss science and nutrition with budyk™.
