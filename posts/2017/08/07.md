accept that heat is a mighty adversary. go to the couch and read about interplanetary wars. wake up to the surprising news of the demise of the apprentice as a victory to social media pressure. scan the comments and then get to the micro-controller. jump from pc to mac and back then get the arduino all figured out. fight the wind for about ten minutes and decide the heat in the shed/sauna/gym is an easier fight. win then top it up with five cays and hottub. boil corn pasta with pesto before ozarks
