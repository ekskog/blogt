Title: THORNS AND LARD
  
**{ 164086083383 }**  
do the dishes by hand, no gloves. swim quite nicely at the pool then get kudos from the chinese lifeguard. learn markdown. update missing urls. ignore the protein bar and blend a banana, a peach, yoghurt, apple juice, hemp and chlorela. attack the thorn with a vengeance. rest, eat left overs at the patio. work. go back and exterminate evil by itâ€™s roots. sweat. grill veggie burgers. focus on eliminating lard from weber. assign two stars to ridley for lameness
