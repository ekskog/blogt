Title: UPP-SALA
  
**{ 164329217668 }**  
beat the sun rise by six minutes, procrastinate then gym for core. take a double brekkie and go in search of photo opportunities, enter the church and leave as the mass starts. take the long way to the abandoned industrial park, get saved by the motorcycle integrator. meet the ar.en.dee then bus back to the train to the taxi to the office. meet the clone of andy then jump on the first wagon to rendezvous with hercule™. make all the way to skogås for a light run on hemp li-nings and a new running hat. discuss dignity and euthanasia and reminisce monty the nachos king. ho back and meet janne and laugh at börje’s bastuklubb and gastro bypass. have a light scare with a nearly depleted key battery but manage to start by turning.
