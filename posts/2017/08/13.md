Title: FIVE HOURS
  
**{ 164165512868 }**  
sneak out before arguments on lengthy weekend training sessions. fill the camelbak with isotonics and the bike bottle with powder meal substitute. take the route suggested by the pee.tee and plan for documented it at the hour, every hour. do very well in kalmar län until taking north instead of south when hitting the motorway. correct in time to drop oneplus twice, this time with consequences. get fooled by evilmaps and reach smallville before planned, take a longer break and a coke. fight back the ridiculous evil wind of blekinge län and see a pee.ar get pulverized. run around the football field, barefeet. immerse in hot water. go to max and eat two burgers before buying cilantro. congratulate the donator_of_y™ who seems to be done much better since a canary arrived. eat falafel with finn-germans and then get depressed with the team.
