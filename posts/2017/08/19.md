Title: CRAYFISH
  
**{ 164405030573 }**  
follow the kalmar iron man online, get mighty impressed at the pros. mix cement and fill the pools in the big stone where the mosquitoes replicate their dna. empty two sacks and decide two more are needed, then acquire them at brick and mortar after deciding for spanish crayfish. decide on taking a different entrance to the balticum, walk accross and rip the neoprene ziper badly. go back, get the other wetsuit. bike dressed as a diver. jump in the swamp, swim about hundred meters in goo. decide on a clockwise swim, against the flow, fight hard and be amazed at the excellent results of breathing after only two strokes. join the teuto-finns for a crayfish party, empty the aquavit bottle then get harrassed by a stupid kid. learn from that. skip the match altogether in an alcoholic haze.
