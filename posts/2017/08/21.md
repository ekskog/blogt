Title: TOTAL ECLIPSE
  
**{ 164474943983 }**  
wake up without a clear purpose for the day. sit around and decide that replacing the wall outlet would be a good thing to do. get in all sorts of awkward positions and eventually use brute force to achieve _partial_ success. look but donâ€™t find a long enough screw. get lost of the time and eat a bar 30 minutes before lunch was due, then join the black ninjas on a lost call. promise to do things that one should not. get distracted and join abhas on vision things. struggle until realising it is super easy indeed. go shopping for very long screws, finish the outlet and pass the test. meet dale#2 and conisder a bbq for his fiftyfive. confirm that polish shoes and chinese cleats are not a match, decide for pool at night and have a good one.
