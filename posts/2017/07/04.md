have eddie veder soundtracking a sandman visit about remembering yesterday. open procedures with hashbrowns and scottish oats. consider bus but walk. make friends amongst future enemies. catch a ride with a beamer then skype with she-boss. stretch it and almost forget to catch a flight home. make it on time for a pint of crisps. slumber through a bumpy ride. sweat in the shed according to the plan, listen to the storm on the plastic roof. consider skipping dinner and give up on the pi. simulate ultraheat then fuck up and recover the macbook.
