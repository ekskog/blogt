start slow by succeeding into reviving mac. give some love to lucifer as a means to speedy recovery. get north as a director, collect the imp and catch lunch with mariposa. walk to football sweden and get amazed with lack of thinking. get the pi to boot and quickly discard a piece of shit hardware made as un-german as possible. run fartleks barefoot on a treadmill while the ni-hao teens giggle.
