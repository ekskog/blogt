hear no rooster singing. get the rest of the stuff packed then empty the fridges in a huge brekkie. donâ€™t check out as the reception was closed. walk to the beach and document the probable beginning of the burst of the mauritius housing bubble, try to run a totally debried beach and give up as the ocean angrily punish the feet and ankles with coral. watch the sunday beach campers feast. wave goodbye to the beach and go get a last shower. jump in the pool instead. go back to find a food truck and watch the sega parade honouring the 250th anniversary of the coastal guard. get two chocolates at spar instead. get a full guided tour via the industrial cities and see the king kong mountain. get rum and european chocolates in exchange of the last rupees. enter the belly of the flying beast. pass the time reading and movie watching.
