rise early then realize it is in fact late considering the time zone. feel a little defeated then move on. embrace the rain and plan the day despite it. watch canard find a dead gecko when looking for the a/c batteries. get credit in skype and still not get hold of a taxi. take the blue bus to la fiora and jump the taxi queue to the scenic route to the lake that came from the head of shiva. laugh at the absurdity of the pantheon and steal a banana from a god to feed a monkey. watch girls praying to a cow. take the cab to the tea plantation and have magnificent lunch. buy the local rum before jump back on the blue bus. keep track of the whereabouts with the blue dot. go for a short run through the sugar cane field. pick the lock with a butcher knife. carbo load with biryani. watch as canard is epiphanic for rahu, the headless one.
