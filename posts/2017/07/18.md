spontaneously decide for walk instead of using public transportation. follow evola’s directions and explore the sugar cane labyrinth, compare the flora to the one of childhood and impress canard with botuanical knowledge. make a left turn at the jeans factory and arrive at one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. jump in and observe the rich variety of fish. have disgusting evil thoughts towards the human race for destroying our home. walk to the lava stones and listen to the surf and greet the fishermen. lend a cyclops to the amputee and make his day. get fooled by ricàrd and travel all the way to soillac in vain. pass on old food both indian and chinese and end up gratinating halal chicken with quinoa penne.
