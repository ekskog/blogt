awake the roosters then eat bread fruit pancakes with nutella. cab to saint felix in the dark then do the grassroots running. follow the brasilian for five cays then decide to stick to the plan. let the monsoon sort of make it much harder. have an internal competition with a dude doing intervals then win. help the sexagenarian then cross the finish line backwards. go back and just let the body recover with music and champagne and south african faux beef.
