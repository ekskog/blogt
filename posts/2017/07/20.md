witness the war of the f'n'f roosters. then prepare a dejeneur très magnifique. make way to porlwi with route one-two-three. pit stop for a phoenix and a pee before engaging the locals in the bazaar. consider a t-shirt, get grossed up by salty octopuses and taste jus de cane. walk the china town maze and sit at a tourist trap for lunch. learn about “the experiment” then head back south, where a weird geezer filmed the legs of g2 for future self-gratification. recharge online, choose litchi instead if tororojo then head to la plage. swim against the current for exercise only then witness the sun set. try the local burger and breathe brit white trash smoke. get the gas chamber treatment, briani style.
