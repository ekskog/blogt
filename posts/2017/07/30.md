take a day “off” on account of epic day. feel a hunger that can’t be described properly, spend the day in glutony. find energy only to tweet but still go out and get parsley for authentic lebanese taboule. as per lectured by ranslb back in 2005. book #one return then buy lots of small shit in china. get the teuto-finns coming over for falafel, unaccompanied for the first time ever. send them off before the game, which was quite an interesting one and we missed a good chance to liquidate the possums.
