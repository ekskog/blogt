consider the paradise island on the east but take the nearer option, reachable by blue bus. take off at the main road and walk to the beach. meet and greet a pair of very scared chinese with hurt ankles, offer to help and get dismissed. look around for baby cactuses to export to the north pole then take a break at a posh wine bar, get a beer and a pinneapple juice. continue alongside the ridiculously oppulent golf course then enter paradise. walk towards the kite surfers and enter the realm of the all-inclusivers. get service denied and for the better. eat at the food truck and serve as a translator for the swiss, the italians and ukranians. eat under the papaya tree. explore the forest side of the peninsula and visit the monument to slavery. find no secluded spot then wave a bus back north. skip the booking at the fancy place and get some nice swordfish at the creole place.
