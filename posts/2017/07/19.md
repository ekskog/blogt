leave savanne and retrace the marathon guided by anil. land at the hotel recommended by cacahu√®ttes. witness a cockroach drowning in the pool. choose the penthouse then go chase brekkie #2\. have a picnic amongst the food trucks and debate with a local old timer the brilliance of brasilian soccer in the late fifties/early sixties. engage the local jewelsmith while trying to convince her that the Indian pantheon is indeed just a space fleet. see the grey clouds takeover make a good environment for reading. taste the local curry and see the canards depart. fight with awful wifi then shop and thai.
