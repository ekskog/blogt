lift the carrier_of_y™ to the train station. notice that some personality traits must be inherited, go back fo a second brekkie then struggle with serial ports and containers. go to the beach and drink the baltic in several gulps. walk back bare chested and devour lunch. procrastinate further then hit the soft track and cheat the last two intervals. soothe in the hot tub and uplifted by island music. then rush to a saxon-finn impromptu grilling with a pit stop at the city gross. cook too much food, eat too fast, get bloated, debate with jeezaz™ about retirement, dignity and end up laughing at cows, elephants and myths. teach him how to make mojitos. decide against waking up in the middle of the night
