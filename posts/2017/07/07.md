feed oats to luci and to self. brick the pie on provisioning, struggle until realize what error 50 is. try the other wet suit, which fits. coach the waterfall a bit more then get curry to go. add a newton w.y.w. check the surroundings then move the plant to the bike shed. try resin it is not better, only easier. put sw on pie and get it to work. bike-run breathing plant fumes. get loads down from cyrus.
