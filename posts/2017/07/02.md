move up and down as a mental note to always choose midships is saved. get expensive brekkie and double pick up service. resume sleeping. make use of guarana powder to greet filet and his first one then go for groceries rubbish and a cleat. get two out if three then brew apples with beetroot and kiwi snd turmeric. bike in recovery mode. Clean the pool, fix the lounge stool. fuck up a mac upgrade then kill time for fashion week trashing. trash it.
