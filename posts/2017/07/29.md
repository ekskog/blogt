Title: EPIC DAY 
  
**{ 163589282488 }**  
sleep uneasy, dream of buildings destroyed by fire. stick to known food and still try to think of a thousand reasons to raincheck. man up and go face fears. meat the other crazies and do reasonably ok on water. be the best of the not so good on the track than eat a lot more than one should. then embarrass oneself on the bike until an opportunity to escape presents itself. get totally choked and realize that well planned out stops will not eat the average pace noticeably. freeze until the body itself finds internal combustion.
