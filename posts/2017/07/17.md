spontaneously decide to follow the sun as per the norwegian institute of meteorology. schedule a cab and get directed to a national park that milks tourists. decline and continue to the west coast. dismiss the snorkeling as they coral was dead because of humans. keep phoenix cold by burying it under the surf. eat some really dodgy albeit delicious fish biryani. leave a tip to mussuri and thank a random god for portable toilet paper. walk to the shops and then miss the last bus. take option two and head south with lord linkey of the mauritian costal highway. complain about ricàrd’s t-shirt allegiance to argentinean polo
