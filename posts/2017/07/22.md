get porta bikes for transportation and exercise. pedal to wolmar for some souvenirs. bargain for a wind chime, two overpriced south african ciders and ice cream. run slowly on soft sand for five cays. look for a better spot to alternate between sun and shade. get towels and a phoenix tee after hard negotiations with marianne. rendezvous at zug for fish briani and lassi. digest it while waging war on muho using sand as the weapon. swim again and do much better this time. watch the sun sets again behind a tiny cloud then cycle back to west sands. consider a sega show but settle for sizzling chicken.
