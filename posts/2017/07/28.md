Title: STOR GOBE
  
**{ 163590360353 }**  
take a white day. fight humongous munchies caused by epic day depletion. invite mand¥™ for a day at the beach, jump on street bikes and have your ears bombed by nagging. find a stone spot in-between random sunbathing swedes. absorb the beauty of it all then get bothered by cold winds. take an early exit before the lunch prices end and put down a whole g-free pepperoni-gorgonzola with extra bacon. discuss flight schedules with #1™ and jump between usb and serial ports. break it for a jacuzzi session.
