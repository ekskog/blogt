Title: BACK ACHE
  
swim. order shoes. old school vans in two different sizes. struggle with the same old same old mqtt even though it is saturday. go for a long run with hokas and perform alright. go bed testing and chose the first one, completely dismissing the very expensive one. do some hot tubbing still conceiling the right calf. surf xpaus for the latest in moving picture entertainment. find out that the book was infinitely better by a million light years.
**a movie:** the snowman (jo nesbo)  
**[ [a song](https://allweexpected.bandcamp.com/track/abano) ]:** abano (hat√†r)
