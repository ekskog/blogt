Title: WILLY FIFTY
  
get ready for the road, then go. misss the right turn and rejoice as it was a better route. soundtrack the trip giving a chance to old timer irish rock'n'rollers, get a bad impression. park at the hotel @h-borg but take the bus number 2 instead of checkin in. jump on the ferry to @h-ore to meet the teuto-finn posse and mingle around the numerous liquor stores with dubious quality rum. find a hip food court and get tapas from a venezuelan that lived in north brazil for years. proceed to the castle xmas market then cab to the hotel to put on a byrne suit. reconvene at the crap burber place for burgers and cigars. enter the sexagenarian meat market then the teen disco. end up in a pub, as it should be.
