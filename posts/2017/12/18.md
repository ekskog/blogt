Title:  NO SLOPE
  
study eventual monday night opportunity for snowboarding and discover obertauern. play with opcua on edge then fix tls for zoch™. spend three intrusive hours on h1/h2 without a lunch break. remember to check for late night equipment return and find out it is a no-no. take to the streets instead. climb to the fortaleza but don’t get in. sample the local christikindl glüwein. cycle intervals and steal ten minutes. skip indian food on germanic countries, consider chinese but settle for japanese.
