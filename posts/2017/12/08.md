Title: BUNKERED
  
down again to the crowne gym but this time tread on the mill using the swedish fart-lek strategy. w_o_w for carrefour express to open, then spend a fifth of the money on a better brekkie. get to the bunker too early considering it is a carrier business, get in and fix udp and then coap but not tls, even though leonardo came to the rescue. get lost in time and almost forget to Ã¼ber to the airport, then panic a bit due to the ridiculous traffic. skip the tax free, get some food on the lounge and top it up with chocolate mousse. uneventfully make it to e twenty-two and home in time.
