Title: JUHAS-NILSSON
  
the return of fritz™painter results in furniture being shifted. the morbylångans appear for coffee and some xmas shopping. with a detour to the toy shop to look at wallpaper. see the palestineans chant and lament the move of the israeli capital in front of the fish fountain, whereas bob™juhas mixes them by syrians. avoid comfrontation by escaping into the thai nuffet. lots of laughs and tired legs and a tiny mohito with teito-finns and back to the hill. two bottles of wine and some cocnonut rum form mauritius alter and #mandy is unable to comprehend mr robot.
