Title: FLAMINGO AND DORKFUNKEL
  
close procedures by having a few more ideas, try them all to no avail, then go and shoot http on the broker and make it work. celebrate on a long run on wrong shoes. wave goodbye to #adrianzand detonate a few resource groups. arrange for an extra suomi day but can’t decide on the route. go and make the back of the bedroom grey. curse at non straight walls. let the bed catch a lot of rain. drink wine then get #one to take #self and #mandy to the pepparstrasse for some good music, singing, rum drinking and witness the birth of something weird -> on this day j™zuzwas not born, instead we saw the sising (?!?) of the great and mighty the flamingo dorkfunkel experience.
