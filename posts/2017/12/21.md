Title: NEW BED ON HBVU
  
more of the same ideas that don’t work, then debug and decide this was not really going anywhere. disassemble the old low bed that makes backs ache. wait for fate™meh while pretending to listen to what the skävdeans have to say. go get the trailer and collect a new bed, make it somehow fit in the little trailer, drive in silence while being mobbed by sheer ignorance and malice. hook the trailer back and drive as far as the ring island bridge where the thing unhooks itself causing an accident of small proportions. wait in the cold for one hour until the tow truck arrives and fix everything in one minute. note to delftie™ -> if it is cold outside, dress properly before going on a drive.
