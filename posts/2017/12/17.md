Title: THIRD ADVENT
  
be advised of silence, then iron, lots and lots of hoodies. take to the shops for stuff to fix curtains, then fix the curtains. put the xmas tree up and some shelves then sofa before taking the road south to the snow. make it in good time for fricadelles then get the bag dispatched at the gate for free, which makes for much better transiting through vienna. lounge with pipe masters and watch the brazuca contingent.
