Title: WORLD WAR TWO
  
bike on the chilled basement then try the austrian version of uber and find out they can’t deliver. tbt and ask reception for a cab. make a pit stop for cash and forget the suitcase in the cab, then realize a headset and gloves were in the hotel. recover the bag and walk to the plc factory. deliver, get good lunch, make it all work first time amazingly. find a hotel online hitch with an engineer to the airport and learn about hitler’s birthplace and the feud between ustriams and turks. drive to dan and get the absolutely last parking spot.
