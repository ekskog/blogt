Title: CAST IRON
  
choke on a bad dream and regurgitate. reconnect with ahata™ then exaggerate on the buffet. pay parking then coap again with a but if cleaning. reassure the boredom of the lake city where no pretty iron has been cast. revisit the parking meter. skip lunch for a quick start with the consultants with ad hoc lights in queerish mesh networks. drive with medieval stories on francis assissi and almost fall asleep. get rescued by tororojo with roasted nuts. remember not to turn on the high beams when driving through a snow storm.
