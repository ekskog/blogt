Title: NARROW BAND
  
do some stationary bike intervals then get robbed on breakfast with the catalanes. shake the sadness of the first leg defeat and cab to the bunker, to team-up with the chinese-polish crew. spend a lot of time solving easy stuff then solve the hard one pretty fast. realise having an own device was not necessary, then get a burger and menu translation by a portuguese waiter.
