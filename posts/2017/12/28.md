Title: WORD MONGOLOID
  
make a final test on the 19k investment and approve it. remember the beetroot and apple and serve it, reduce the oats by half. make a todo list and manage fifty percent. enroll boosaardig™ on lamitja, educate on the differneces between facinity and vicinity and get a word mongoloid tag. get back to onboarding and complete a few more. open for frank™thepainter and move the imelda collections away. unscrew then go back to pane of glass. eat then replenish cupboards. try more visualizations and fall asleep on keyboard. move to bed, wake up and hit the asphalt dismally.
