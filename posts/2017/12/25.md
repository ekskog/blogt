Title: TURKEY (THE BIRD)
  
get downtown for a breather on whatever shop happens to be open. schedule a massage maybe then watch mand¥™ buy unnecessary jeans patches. go back and eedeeex some pbi. do a half arsed bike run then drive #1™ to the end of the udde. continue to the™walkerzfor turkey blackpool style and then some table games where the testosterone team proves their excellent knowledge on flags. consider crossing the bridge for new year but fail to use loyalty points.
