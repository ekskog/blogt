Title: HOT ENOUGH
  
sun comes out then go out and remove all **visible** traces of winter. then **simulate** successfully a home full of electricity hungry appliances. have a very late breakfast that screws up the plans. **sleep**. wake up and try to **repeat** yesterday's performance. succeed. then join the walkers for the **inauguration** of the bbq season. top it up with three **gingers** and exit before the yawning symphony becomes **cacophonous**.Â 
**a movie**: fences (denzel washington)  
**[ [a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYDhw8_lAn0) ]**: i cut like a buffalo (the dead weather)
