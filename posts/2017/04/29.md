Title: ROTTEN WOOD
  
give up on **lousy** battery life. swap by **something** that will last while you wait. then go lift heavy wood at pepparatraße. cut cycling short due to lack of **oxygen** in grasshopper’s lungs. then raincheck the **hackathon**. pop a green pill then have **hallucinating** dreams. replenish with mixed **beirut** grill. shoot me but i like ben’s movies. 
**a movie**: live by night (affleck)  
**a song**: black acid (roman flügel)
