Title: PV=nRT
  
start by **pausing** and reflecting. continue filling excel cells **furiously** and soundtrack it with bootlegs courtesy of yup-yup. **ahata** longs for machu picchu. feel very **breathless.** because the air is very thin. acknowledge being the  **animal** with lower levels of zen-sensitivity. then put the dead pig in the **pressure** cooker and leave it to turn into pulled pork. realize you will be examined tomorrow, **panic** for five seconds then non-challantly **dismiss** the thought. 
**a song:** mother of pearl / the horoscope demos version (bryan ferry)
