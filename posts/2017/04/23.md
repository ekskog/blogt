Title: THIRTY
  
feel it on the **quads**. feel it on the **calves**. enjoy **good** pain. move from sofa to sofa killing time before the **semifinals**. think for a **second** about cycling, then rejoice the rain gives an excuse. as **excuses** go watery brown goo is always reliable. watch the gals in the garden, while having a **hilarious** phone chat about sex starvation and violins. watch the semifinals **unfold** favorably.Â wonder if the silent minute before the game was for your first **best friend**
**a song:** love harder (kyla la grange)
