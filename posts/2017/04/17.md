Title: FREE MONDAY
  
rest day. feel **distressed** about what to do with the day then do nothing. get the **mannequin** factory zipped for jazz. lay the faux brown zebra **underneath** the bed. then lecture people about not **needing** to change your password every other day if you will keep them in a **notebook** labeled “passwords” next to the keyboard. eat the **duck**. bloat. get irritated by **meaningless** parallels chit chats. it’s not everyday that you have your entire life.
**a movie:** collateral beauty (fresh prince)  
**[ [a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC9UOmF1dcg) ]**: xingu (ozric tentacles)
