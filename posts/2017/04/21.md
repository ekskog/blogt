Title: FEET
  
**beat** the alarm by one hour. fly. then decide to **skip** the metro. get **yoga** from aitee while trying different flavors of **exotic** juices. scan the printed paperbacks under the sofa for stereotypes. count **untowelled** heads and then join hercule at the dusty damascus food court. eat **lebanese** of course. with frozen yoghurt. get **irritated** with the lack of presentation skillzof a partner in crime then be amazed that g1 shows a picture of **pasach** when searching for self. waste time walking to the **shoe outlet** and decide to order online. arrive too early at the airport and skip swimming **altogether**, get a pizza instead on the account of **carboloading**.Â
