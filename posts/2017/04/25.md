Title: HMI17 DAY ONE
  
make the **wrong** turn. for the better. **punish** your toes. then get on **line six** to ost two. dislike it **immediately** and wonder why there are still trade shows in this day and age. eat a lot of **chocolate** and top it up with overprice but very tasty goulash. go robot **spotting**. no joy on getting a free messenger bag. meet a welshman. go back **regret** the lack of warm clothes. it is april **goddamnit**. eat syrian leave no tips for **horrible** service. yawohl!
**[ [a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PijjhnwZ77g) ]**: they say (tim schaufertb)
