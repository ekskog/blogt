Title: THE GOVERNMENT  
  
get out, collect **dandelion** leaves for the devil. then **start** procrastinating. just because. find that chinese **logistics** have not improved but rejoice when one of the forty thieves appears at your mailbox. **schedule** sushi and forget to check postings on the website and be surprised that the pool was occupied unexpectedly. drive home **dejectedly** and raincheck the duck. pray for a change in the weather, confirmed by your chinese **barometer**, then start a **gruesome** fight agains the wind to keep the good results of lately. lose to the **wind**, of course. learn from a twat how to interact with **nigerian** scams.Â
