Title: GRAFITTI  
  
nothing like waste time on **useless** content and fourteen absurd questions. then cheat with **screenshots**. do the duck thing (a pb in honor of my dark furred nephew) and start **believing** you will manage. eat properly. then **ignore** what needs to be done and do what gives intellectual satisfaction. 
**[ [a mixtape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=norOFK99InU) ]**: don’t forget to fly (coccolino deep)  

**a book**: the dark forest (cixin liu)
