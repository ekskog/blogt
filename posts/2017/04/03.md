Title: ANOTHER LOUNGE
  
**monday** and the pool is only open at night. **procrastinate**. tell oneself that one must work on slides then just put together work from others and call it **deckart**. then take the very awkward route to horsens as if **intending** to shake off a tail. en route try a different lounge, the one for **second class** travelers. recharge.Â 
**[ [an album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVO_R8uvMhE) ]**: antiphon (alpha mist)
