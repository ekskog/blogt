Title: HMI17 DAY TWO
  
get cash from the **gas** station - the subway does not **honor** plastic. arrive early and still queue forever but manage to get a **courier** bag. at the booth make a call to congratulate the **longevity** of the x-chromosome provider. eighty three. entertain a welshman **forever** and use it as an excuse to sit. eat non proper and feel the calves **crippling**. take a taxi back and decide that **football** is stronger than procrastinating. add insult to sore calves and get self-reward with double **mango lassi.** discover quite late what bonnie and mommie have in **common**.
**a movie**: stop making sense (demme)  
**[ [a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PijjhnwZ77g) ]**: you donâ€™t miss your water (eno/cale)
