Title: LEAVING HANNOVER
  
let the sun make the hard **decision** of go/no-go. take the right turn and go all the way to collect a happy thought around **maschsee**. ignore garmin and stop to take photos and then get lost when the **batteries** go flat. go back and clean then leave in search of interesting **material** for the other tumbler. end up **pumping** cash into the local economy by the means of chinese jeans and swedish no frills running shoes. then off to munich which the **americans** seem to use as a hub to disperse thorugh europe.Â
