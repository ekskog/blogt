Title: AUTOMATE
  
wake up and **go**. around the **lake**. fight the fog and get purple **fingertips**. get reshuffled and **pretend** it is a big thing. accept it. then **fiddle** with the flow and decide to name drop statisticians and nobel prize winners. get **bogged** by awfully bad rendering as a reminder we are still doing things our (wrong) way. **cucumber** mint and ginger. escape early enough to **witness** a car crash that required three ambulances. **fly**.Â
