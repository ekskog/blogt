Title: STAEDY STEADY
  
It’s always a good idea to stay **safe**. yes, long white tube socks is a very useful **protection** item (against mosquitoes). and **wearing** racing flats for a quick getaway - the man is virtuous. send instructions about how **punctuation** is important sometimes - there are maggots and trillion of evil **bacteria** living inside this cake. be assimilated, follow the path of least **resistance**, yoda and orange socks as super bad taste **feet fetish** porn. then go to a car boot sale and get **ferry** with wetton on vinyl for one buck. get back to eighty-six via kafka **drawings**. swim (slow) run (**slow**). sleep. get the moped out of the **shed**. fetch the filet for an **impromptu** bbq with airplane gazing. get irritated with the **intern** (again).
