Title: HEALTH  
  
**killing** time at the train station lounge then finding out logistics have provided the wrong address, amusingly a 22km taxi ride in stockholm costs more than a 550 km plane ride. got to **educate** la crème and a korean postdoc both unaware of palm pilots then met an older man of iron, a real pioneer. forced myself to ride and pump jumped on a dodgy scale then **compensated** by eating tiblisi kabab and drinking water with wax. for those that liked **coincidences**, a young rich.com was fiddling with a palm pilot, damn…  
**a tv show:** blindspot  
**a song:** cold sweat (james brown)
