Title: REBOOT  
  
as the **virus** retreats, a reboot is possible. going out with lots of false starts for bad **memory** and leaving gear behind, wrong gloves, hands frozen after 6.5 minutes made easier by listening the life of scott. lots of **dirt** everywhere so the automobiles jumped in the cycle wash bandwagon, powerful chemicals to dissolve asphalt and complete void the balticum of animal life. **shaking** hips to punk music while roasting own granola is not something the girl likes or the boy can avoid snapchatting and lolling, but WGAF?  
**a movie:** passengers  
**a (audio) book:** eat and run (scott jurek)  
**a song:** charlie donâ€™t surf (the clash)
