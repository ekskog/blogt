Title: ETHERNET  
  
i swear i was going to **circle** kungsholmen was it not for the very slippery conditions went fishing in the aquarium instead. made on time for a meeting postponed so got chicken kebap and discussed dog **euthanasia** with bob then went for the traditional round of keeping the economy wheel spinning but returned empty handed to get **depressed** by old industrious swedes excited about ethernet ports. walked to a footwear outlet that closes on mondays and tuesdays listening to super boring fusion rock guitar before flying back to watch **a feast** of champions goals/bad defending.Â  
**a tv show:** homeland  
**a song:** sex (larry coryell)
