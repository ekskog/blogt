Title: LITHURGICAL  
  
gifted my favorite **beanie** to a stranger in the bus when discovering a different route via the projects, then not being able to surface. **raincheck** on algeria and shawarma and shopping with bob™notboilen. a quick detour to the library to expose the **false professor** culminating with mass at the press association. 
**a dialogue:**  
- in motion now very first door of train  
- now on tube, 1st wagon, 2nd pair of doors, will pop out head to make a visual with you  
- wearing a grey beanie and spectacles bob, pure 80s **techno goth dance** bliss  
- still have it, i guess in the attic  
- sell it to me, you heathen! your mozis pristine, gigantic  
- and you are the kirby silver surfer, most of the old acidheadzi knewzloved these like kids like jelly babies  
- pills thrills bellyaches and speedway i pray  
**a song:** dirty disco (section 25)
