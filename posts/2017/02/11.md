Title: APRÈS-SKI  
  
one can make **peace** as long as one doesn’t deal with the real issues, then go shopping. the slope was indeed open but **the** lift was not on, so only good for sledging. we did the ironing then went for pizza, beers, **submarines** and hot-tubbing with phantoms. then argued about the proper **formula** to successfully raise kids, no settlement reached.
