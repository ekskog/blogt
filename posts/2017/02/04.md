Title: TIMECO
  
theâ„¢bear shows up and we have two different **flavours** of the breakfast of the champions, red bull or beer. regardless, the **punishment** was there.  
taking to the camp nou with two **bassists** to witness a crowd of tourists, not really a football match, more like a **tourist attraction**. guilty.  
a **cab ride** to granollers costs 20 times the return ticket on the renfe, but that is the price one pays for having a narrow window of opportunity. tapas **upgraded** across the street from where we sleep.
**a song:** this is steve (delicate steve)
