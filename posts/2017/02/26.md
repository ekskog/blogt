Title: FAUX  
  
**janitor** sunday to accumulate points. underneath the fridge one could find the finest randomly assembled **granola**. got lectured about elbows and water hugging, **improvements** on the way. the black wall is up the black list has been **caught up** with. from diamond to gold to silver **consecutively**. which is a way to attest i am reducing my **footprint** on the planet. plus a second day without putting corpses in the **sanctuary**.  
**sequencial art:** mosaic (thorne/randolph)  
**a song:** bad blood (nao, sbtrkt)
