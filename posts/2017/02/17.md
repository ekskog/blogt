Title: THE RAILWAY  
  
delftie™  kinda tried harder but merkert™s snoring was **relentless** and it won in the end, so i got a suite with a spanish guitar instead of a bible or the book of mormon. as **mensa tests** and bar quizzes are concerned delftie™ always wins then nails the germans upside down on a skype bridge, segue on a very long journey northeast on the **pendulum** listening to trendy african ambient which induces inevitably sleep.
**sequential art:** the killing joke (alan moore)  
**a movie:** manchester by the sea  
**a song:** blinta madiallo (francis bebey)
