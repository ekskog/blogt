Title: EYERGASM  
  
having lied about **timetables** and landing times just to learn that the meeting had been postponed since friday is the perfect **aftermath**. spent time getting used to the fact that delftie™ will not exceed **expectations** for the first time since the dawn of the universe. get over it. move on…  but nothing can make bad a day that brings the conclusion of the best comic book story ever written. god bless warren ellis, the **profane** **procrastinator**. then top it up explaining to #2™ why there will never be peace in the **promised land.**  
**a tv show:** mammon  
**sequential art:** karnak (warren ellis)  
**a song:** junior dad (lou reed with metallica)
