Title: THE REVOLUTION  
  
got **immersed** in ellis-world by the means of a bird’s whisper, then obviously signed up for the mailing list (?!). the painter came and needed **babysitting** but not coffee, but at least he was fast and reliable. got lured by bob to replace an aged yet still fully functional cheesy rucksack, well if someone has to oil the wheels of **capatilism** (spellting like that as it must mean something else) let it be me! me! me!  
while listening to weird electronica i somehow managed to tap the beat i will always **associate** to my dad and laid down in ableton.  
the bike **adjustments** by phantom worked i think but i need more. a **swordfish** got re-introduced in the scheme of things and it was delish.  
**sequential art:** supergods (ellis)  
**a song:** sensoria (cabaret voltaire)
