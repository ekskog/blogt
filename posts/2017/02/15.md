Title: THE NIGHT BEFORE  
  
a day spent performing **transplants** in apples. resetting cloud **passwords** that could too easily be guessed. getting **acquainted** with pete when he was a proper guitarist with the non heir of the marriott hotels. then **spending** the night on said hotel to be able to show up in time for the morning departure.  
without a doubt the best music has jaki liebezeit **rythm** patterns.
**a song:** nowhere again (the secret machines)
