Title: THERE IS ALSO ICE
  
a very slow **motorcade** to the flight station with mand¥™, where the parking ay-eye refused to let more cars in because it thought it was full when the snow covered its sensors. made it however j.i.t. to ikki, despite the interesting **combination** of a snow covered motorway and a somalian bus driver.   
segue into a laugh at one-two-one and an empty office, falouk **halloumi** and i almost lost my flight back to west siberia. made it however j.i.t. to watch e22 **score**, despite a completely white e22.
**a book:** choke (chuck palahniuk)  
**a song:** NIV (lambchop)
