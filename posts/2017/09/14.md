Title: SHOOT
  
**{ 165339114488 }**  
start at midnight by watching the lazy public servants in red/black yawn through a game. mix oats with m√ºsli then waste time killing resource groups while chatting to a clueless khan trying to recover certificates. fix the plc by disabling secure boot. connect everything that can be connected then cycle in the shed to dictators are us. skip the run on account of the monsoon. manufacture tortillas then pay homage to **grant hart** by pogoing and shouting to nova mob, whose most played song has about 5000 streams. people are just idiots.
