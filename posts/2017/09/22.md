Title: LUGGAGE CARROUSEL
  
**{ 168072281593 }**  
wake before the rooster and almost drop from the slippers at exhotbox™ looking like the scarecrow from hell. pay everybody’s cab and get expensive rum. slumber most of the flight but miss the train, conveniently getting a bk lunch. try to code but give up and just sleep more. deliver magazines to mand¥™ and put the cushions in the attic boxes.
