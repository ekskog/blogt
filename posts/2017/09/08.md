Title: FRANzREMEMBERS
  
**{ 165252842428 }**  
do the cross by force of habit when we score then kick the duvet when the goalie gives it all away. manage to re-sleep, prepare oats on the ice bucket then go for intervals on the mini gym, top it up with core. take the tube to a trip of reminiscing rock'n'roll. wonder at the architecture and see the original drawings. miss the tomb on the account of being charged for it and tour the city snapping random chinese snapping at everything. take a cab to the airport and uneventfully skip the shopping.
