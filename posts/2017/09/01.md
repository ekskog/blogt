<p>give the gift of dao to mand¥™. do right by the whale at last then spend the time with erix™ remotely, ask the right questions.  do the egg thing and get back to the whale. do another time wasting phone session then fight about a red box. go to the ex posh place and celebrate with a fejø cider. get irritated by a german wanker and remember it is only fiction.</p>
