wake up into chores. assemble five drawers then shuffle stuff. continue to the laundry room and organize, make it more spacious and still fit more. fill drawers with sports clothes and then more. retake the office over. go to the asphalt and do what could have been done. sleep, grill, use whatsapp to say happy 53. wonder at the birds prepare to go south. board the coastal arrow. work, watch the footie. repeat.
