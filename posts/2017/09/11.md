Title: FJORDS
  
**{ 165252806433 }**  
curse soccer and go down like a sleepwalker. decline the walk and take the shuttle. realize thirty more minutes in bed would not have hurt, hide from the russian. board the black military plane and sleep. land in the fjords and hail a cab with the customers. kick ass and make friends with the obnoxious german. dcline the offer of a clean desk and try to walk to the fjords. go as far as the end of the road and decide to scavange hunt for manholes. jump back in the black bomber then eat the greasiest burger ever before the east bound train departs. quickly master tsdbs and then taxi again.
