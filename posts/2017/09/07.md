Title: VISTU PANASTUP
  
**{ 165252818513 }**  
forget the birth of the nation and hail a cab to the old town, eat brekkie with pss™dk then the limousine to the factory at kladno. rush trough the agenda on account of poor english skills then take the full tour of the toy factory. take over the task of inspiring and accomplish it. get laughs for plain vanillas and “there you gos”. go back to praha 3 then use up chi on a super lazy session on the stationary. take the eletritska to town and choose pad thai over goulash. look for franzand reconnect with pirralha™ over trips when we were young. set the clock to the final of the cup. learn about the pass of **holger** the bassman.
