Title: COASTAL ROAD
  
**{ 165822395358 }**  
lose the fight with small pillows. get a good start on the beach road but empty the tank quickly, get nausea from beetroot. feel the quads and explain to the waiter the difference between agave and honey. fight with gps because of self but miss the parking. sit with the hackers instead of the sellers. get yet another bad lunch at the canteen then make an early escape, with a pit stop at the shoe sale. fight a bit more with gps and bad e47 queues. get the normal tororojo shot and wake up alright. stop for gas unusually early and retire for the cup final
