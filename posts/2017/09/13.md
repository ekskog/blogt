Title: PLASTER OUTSIDE THE HIGH SCHOOL
  
**{ 165301650238 }**  
get acquainted with mainly matteus and pens, courtesy of a bored herc™ locked during his commute by a hard train reset at solna. try and fail to config the plc then decide it is all good. get into water for some lousy crawling then fix #1™s iPhone for free and reward self with sushi buffet. get back in time for a bizarre phone call where the second half was in dutch. prepare for the storm then go shopping in time to witness the catching of a shoplifter. resurrect the rpi and swap iPhones around. lose loose change betting on combined results.
