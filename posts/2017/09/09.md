Title: DENISE
  
**{ 165177381008 }**  
watch the monsoon falls and ruin a perfectly planned saturday. open ivar’s box and curse at bad quality control. go shopping and trip on mand¥™s dialogue replays. put an extra layer and get on asphalt. do an excellent first half then get so wet and frozen that the pace drops to agony. cut it short by two hours and still miss the departure of #1™. feel the complete emptiness. get wet further in the bathtub. sleep a little than mount the body. consider blueberry falafels but decide for a quiet pizza with her™.
