Title: HEAT VIA VIDEOCONF
  
**{ 165291498168 }**  
spend the morning figuring out how to master tsi and tsdb. then connect the plc and a few fakes and voilà, kick ass swiftly. learn that the cto is just a phony and the it girl knows a lot. connect to ex™hotbox who tried to look positively at a pay cut, all stock options considered. ignore most of it and move on. jump on the felt and try to do a peebee on the normal 1hr route but get diverted by the road repair unit. do a peebee anyways. consider for a second to do a quick run but decide to play with docker hub instead. ignore the champions league and close the watch harold get cremated.
