Title: ÜBERALLES
  
turning over turning round twisting in my sweat. very uneasy sleep. a **slumber**. two billiard balls and adios physics.  
hallelujah we are saved! bruce himself will deliver us from all evil, even evil commuting in **unconnected** wagons.  
collect **manholes**, start today, only making sure the vulture with upset tummy is resting in a different tree, then sushi with a politician on the dole soon.  
all über drivers in dk are called **omar** or mohammed and can’t use gps. that meant i ended up in the **transsibiriska** train eastbound with an out of function pissoir.
**a song:** john mclaughlin (miles davis)
