Title: POSTNORD
  
clocking a totally crap 11, blame it on a mighty awful sleep in the green-seeds. or maybe soundtrack a run with avant-gard swedish electronica was a bad idea.  
as colors come, red is very immature and if it got used in guailan it would have been funny.  
empirically speaking, dutch postmen are honest, brazilian postmen are not. i learnt today that european royal families have a tendency to marry with women from countries that beat them in footbal world cup finals.
**a song:** feedback song for a dying friend (legião urbana)
