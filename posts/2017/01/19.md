Title: HAAG v01.17
  
started the day counting cars at 4 am on an empty motorway. eastbound won by a landslide (40-6, 40-2).  
then spotting a black barchetta that surely belongs to someone’s uncle and doing a fifty-fifty alongside a form perfect white rabbit. then, adding insult to injury, getting totally trousers out-funked by said rabbit. then eschering at emma’s under the influence of fish plus plus. which obviously led to a lengthy discussion around a project plan to verify the authenticity of a claim made by an argentinean steak house.
