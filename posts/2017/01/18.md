Title: SHAWN
  
i sense disagreement, something like waters x gilmour (or gallagher x gallagher) - we on puncture subject now or something else? not necessarily, just social check on if can move the clock to 5 to midnight, time is money or was it the other way around?  
bingo somehow reminds me of that old scary bald guy from bingolotto and i get the creeps, but i feel your scientific approach - after a 360 or even a 720 inspection you can pump up to max pressure and bobs your uncle and fanny’s your aunt.  
happy xmas shawn from jamaica - remember: a date with the bruce can’t be missed, his holiness is not to be messed with. it is been said (but not confirmed) - nobody that ever messed with the bruce have come forward
