Title: WHERE THE OFFICE IS
  
supposedly a class two weather. perhaps on the top of the bridge, westward. bang bang hello toerag, hello cameltoe, all energized for bringing up the trekorv game to a new level. empty spaces soon to be filled by snooty punks that can code java and who want monster salaries in analvej. secretly going to the gym with a pitsop at ikea.
