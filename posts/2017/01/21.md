Title: FABBEMÅLA FROZEN 
  
observed the weather hoping to go outside. then acquired a hopefully useful machine to make crispy cassava without oil. and the weather looked promising and it was for 40 kms until augerum turned into ellowen-deeowen and it could have been my last day on a bend near lòsen. extremities numb and all not even a hot tub could mend, which was made considerably harder by rewatching sandra having premonitions. 
**a song:** hammond song (the roches)
