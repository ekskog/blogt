Title: THE OLD HOUSE
  
i would rather not have gone but i did and it was an un-event. remember this: if the caller says rabbit you have to say the cat’s name or the **cavalry** will show up. pay tribute to the bassman “go johnny gone”, but make sure you do it in vinyl. red vinyl, no other **colour** will do. 
**a song:** one more red nightmare (king crimson)
