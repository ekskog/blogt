Title: GEOGRAPHIES
  
deal with objects. fight then capitulate. reclaim the stewardship of the induction plates with polenta. go hard against the wind then wood throttle with g2dot0™ before taking on asphalt with fake sneakers. fetch mixed grill but consume it as plans are made for pedaling around the river where the king fishes for salmon. attack prime’s geofencing but make no dent. the cat claims victory as claritin was not defending. trade pictures of tongues with the yangwun through the yellow ghost
