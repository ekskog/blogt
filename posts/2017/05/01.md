Title: INCOME
  
support the t-cells on their **relentless** fight against the german/korean invaders. then extend up both middle fingers to the **taxman**. enough is **enough** and vice-versa. deliver the signed forms down the metal mouth of **beelzebub** then drive back for more horizontalism. catch up on some lame tv series and eat what the **vultures** left over. campaign online against a **communist** holly-day but enjoy the time of regardless. 
**a book**: death’s end (cixin liu)   
**a song**: bales (yorkston/thorne/khan)
