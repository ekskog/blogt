Title: RUN THE BRIDGE THEN SOME
  
sort the socks. get the sacred mantel then drive. make it at the exact last minute. sneak in and find the ecuatorian there. reconsider tactics and decide to give him a run for his money. use a good form and fly. spot the rabbits and use them as inspiration. go all the then a bit more. feel super fresh on the bus and honor the sponsors. replenish the glycogen storage with pizza.
