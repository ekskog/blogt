Title: TUBES
  
get proof of the **fallibility** of british punctuality. **blame** on xx. then have the karma god come down on the tubes with a **revenge**. four times. admit **defeat**. pour **concrete** instead. greet x and feel **infinite** sadness over the tears of y. ‘it is very **hard’**. let **dignity** always win over longevity. have this **imprinted** so hard in the soul that it invades dreams. 
**[ [a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZAO8hSdHw) ]**: peter and the wolf theme (prokofiev)
