Title: MARKETING A GOD
  
spin kungsholmen **anti clockwise**. miss a great opportunity to **scavenge** street art under a bridge to keep up a **strong** pace. have breakfast listening to **brasilian** tourists complaining about sweaty people in sports attire. get **swarmed** by small girls from somalia wearing the **burqa** to school. tease g2dot0™ with snaps of fancy **office space.** rendezvous with dehaines™ at dusty damascus then go watch **gypsies** beg on the square. get approached by the **church keeper** looking to acquire new paying subscribers to salvation by the lamb. food coach abhab™ then waste more time on someone else’s **chores**. get no wifi on an overcrowded **airport** then discuss health insurance for the elder in the portuguese atlantic coast.
