Title: ROADFIT
  
since at home, make sure all **expenses** are properly claimed. spend half a day at that and therefore generate zero **shareholder** value. take the car to the wrong m.o.t. **inspection** center then praise the god of free enterprise and competition and drive 400 meters to a competitor. accept with zen **panache** that nothing will get done as it is match day. book a mini tour of **scandinavia** instead. climb the cherry tree and make use of an old **metalcore** cd as a mirror to convince the magpies to nest elsewhere. then cook vegan **awesomeness** as an attempt to cure g2 sore ears.Â
