Title: OBSOLETE
  
**delay** the start of the day. then get it done while **texting** ahata™. chores then expenses and watch the time flies over **messaging** apps. swim then get rid of obsolete **currency** and while at it compliment the barber of kosovo on the new salon, collect earplugs and realize the chinese have **colonized** estonia for easier logistics to the european union. decide to skip the raw fish and have a philosophical discussion about brazilian  **metaphors** using fish and bones. and the effect of three beers on the old coast. which obviously can only lead to a vicious and **unsuccessful** attempt to acquire a black t-shirt from a french strip club. proceed toward **moominland** on business class. end up in a hotel named after a **vampire**.
