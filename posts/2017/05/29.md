Title: A TWAT
  
recognize brands. enjoy more if the box is a beauty. meet abhas™ and get another white box. scavange for power chords then be ignored by the salesmen yet another day. blame it on continuous integration. assemble with boosaardig™ konijn then head to the capital. regret the choice of garment and replace with chinese branded camo-cargo-shorts. pay an extra fifty percent on account of zippers. find ganesha this time then meat feast. discuss a possible ancestor of the voodoo child as the owner of a car wash. light it while admiring futuristic buildings and even more land being captured for prime real estate. get slightly lost looking for the venue. arrive in time for three elfish songs. surround oneself with bearded hipsters and chubby chicks with a lot of sensitivity. observe the effect of iceland on songwriting. get told off by a hipster for polluting the gig with loud chit chat. elaborate on the need fir strobing green leds on a synth that is never touched. witness a bizarre moment when drunk punters have a snapshot taken with train fare controllers. learn the short way to cheznijn. 
**a gig**: low roar  
**a song**: how much is the milk (scooter)
