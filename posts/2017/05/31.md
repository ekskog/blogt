Title: TWO COUNTRIES COLLAGE
  
check-out **express**. **repurpose** gfree bread. get in **second**. get out **first**. get **ignored**. **bargain** for a plc. and a sticker. get nada. get **worried** about cumpadre. get to green seeds by cab then **circle** the lake with the ay-eye. get relief from the **knowledge** of a lung locked fart. get **sustenance** from tv roasted chicken. eat **only** half. tune the **violin**. which coincidentally was the first clue as **painted** by don pablo. get totally thrilled by **paper** eating hired black yasasins. “your life has no value, but do you speak spanish, no?”.
**a movie**: the limits of control (jim jarmusch)  
**[ [a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqApo9BWK3s) ]**: funnel of love (sqürl)
