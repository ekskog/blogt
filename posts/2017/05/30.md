Title: DESIGN WIN
  
sneak out. travel second class. to **housemartins**. or anywhere. give away one third of a seat to a smelly (blond) **pachyderm**. unavoidably stare at a gorgeous flat chested (raven haired) **ferdinand**. acquire **memorabilia**. snap street-art for **madame**. skip uber and take the intercity to the stronghold of dutch **catholicism**. take the walk through dutch furniture **wasteland** towards the insurers. get the full tour of the warehouse of **engineering** porn. capture a win. go back on the non-stop direct. continue to be **ignored**. leave. create a lab then pedal for two hours with the help of **winona’s** ex. 
**[ [a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlKQAXOohHc) ]**: won’t give you up (tom tom club)
