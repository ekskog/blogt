Title: THE SUN
  
give up on the dishwasher. get a new one from suomi. schedule convenient delivery. collect the magpie egg. sweat. skip cooking. get yet another crappy burger. never learn. move around the pub as per the position of the sun. observe humans. reminisce of days of old queuing for huge ice-creams.
