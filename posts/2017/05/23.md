Title: NOREG
  
ride the faqir with a hard tail wind. make it in half the time. arrive before them all. connect. sanitize then regain access to the gold lounge. sanitize more. be fooled by norwegian exit signs and trains. realize oslo in the summer is a total different game. shop cheap for sweat and be grateful for the sun. take the beach promenade than the park the museums then turn back. re-engage the squirrel™ and plan for discovery. wait. get treated with fish and allsorts the fish for a change or to get back where there is belonging. 
**[ [a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjWcF1QJx1Y) ]**: do you want the truth or something beautiful (paloma faith)
