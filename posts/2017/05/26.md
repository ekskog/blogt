Title: HALF STRAW EGG
  
miss the water for the red day. numb it with white pigmented oil and a sub-par alice in chainâ€™s with a cookie monster. do it faster and without breaking the back. get bothered again for fitness and sleep then change locks as keys are made to be lost. trim some lose ends then hang an egg by a tree. run further on the hardest track under the sun. skip alien and get numbed again with car chases in lousiana.
**a movie**: kidnap (halle berry)  
**[ [a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUGda7GdZPQ) ]**: show yourself (mastodon)
