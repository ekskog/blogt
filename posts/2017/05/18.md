Title: EXIT
  
accept the **inevitability** of already having predicted a fatal outcome. nag like a small bird **online**. then get depressed over a **glass** half empty. shed tears for the river on a half full **plane**. **humiliate** the machine on backgammon. select a sad thought from **turnpike** lane. keep seeing the ghost of **nilsson** at the airport. gather with all the **others** and have lunch at the terrace with the better ones. do someone else’s job and **laugh** at the half a million price tag. hit the place where you tracked the **volcano cloud** for a quick nap. then bike then run then **lamb** curry
**[ [a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkcP4ywEBgo) ]**: i don’t blame you (cat power)
