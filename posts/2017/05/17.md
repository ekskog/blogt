be the machine that does the **dishes**. then reach out for the **repairman** and the insurance man. hit the **water**. rendezvous with leduc™. pretend to listen to the **voices** on the phone. then grease everything while performing a ball-bearing **open heart surgery**. run in shorts without a single **gadget**. remove foam from the **jacuzzi** then eat out. witness a **battery** go from eighty to dead in three seconds.
