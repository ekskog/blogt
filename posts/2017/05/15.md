Title: THE BLOOD
  
beat the alarm clock by one hour, courtesy of a nightmare on the left side of the bed. hit the road and experience a traffic jam after gladsaxe. waste time in meetings then steal apple cider to fight sleep on the way back. use she-walker numberâ„¢ and do a solid forty eight. awkwardly meet a super sweaty nurse and witness inadequacy as words vanish.
**a song:** upon this tidal wave of young blood (clap your hands say yeah)
