Title: CEMENT
  
consider an early start. make pancakes instead. then pour the rest of the cement and get the stones an icelandic motif. get another tube pierced and still peebee but not by much. blame the wind. get motivation and tears from neumannâ„¢ when you top it up around the ring island. celebrate swedish moms. assemble shelves to boy. let your hate for the intern grow.
