Title: PUB GAMES
  
drap the jaw in awe to death’s end as a work of art in **words**. have a dialogue around bobby peru’s **quotes** and end up market scanning for an yoga nostril cleaner. get locked in a conf room with the most **obnoxious** salesman on the planet. hitch a hike with **data scientists** then play golf in the living room. get the best result **despite** not having stereo vision. unnecessarily run to catch a train and end up meeting the filet on the **lounge**.
**[ [a song:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pin2C8W78EU) ]** stay (grace pool)
