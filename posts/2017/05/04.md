Title: THE DANISH RAILS
  
set two **alarms** just in case. then sleep so light they never **ring**. resort to all sorts of **superstition** to influence the outcome of a football game. stand entirely **convinced** you did. then take an early train then **another** then another. snap wagons as **canvas** then discuss the pod future with catiger and reach no conclusion. get **confused** with all tee-el-ays but find comfort on the pee-el-cee. train the way back only this time get **sardined** while crossing the sund. go in **peace** saxa.
**a song**: the doors of your heart (the beat)
