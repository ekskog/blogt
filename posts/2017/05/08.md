Title: REDLIGHT
  
let the **euphoria** of 34 stop sleep from coming. take an early exit to the airport where a freaky **accident** with a hare adds disruption to a lot of lives. get late and seek **compensation** and get it in form of ¾ of a chicken curry. redirect to a loungeless **terminal** and fly royal. arrive jit to miss all the fun then get **rainchecked** by abhas™. **schedule** the rendez-vous with boosaardig konijn™. but not before messing up with **courtyards**, which was not wasted as an **opportunity** to enjoy the dutch bus system. let kwaad konijn get lost then **appear** in the middle of red light looking for mumbai but accept beirut instead, where the waiters want to start a **propaganda** campaign against the syrians in södertälje. sit by the **brasilian** by parrot zik.  
**the chitchat**: never trust amex to book your hotel. damn dutch railway system of lair evilness. deliver me joyful news then. you can’t even spell your god’s name, evil is always my first choice, fire and brimstone for the best argentine beef outside of montevideo. 
**[ [a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUqcBwQjj4k) ]**: get down saturday night (oliver cheatham)
