Title: BALL BEARINGS
  
make it a habit to beat the alarm. make it through the village that names the air station. fly the faqir north then southwest. land at international then get sniffed by monty’s kid brother. stare at the blond wife of black bolt. be late and still arrive before abhas. poison thyself with tororojo by exercising freewill. inhale exhale. understand the screwed up timelines made up by texting and flying. get there before abhas and get hooked to geocaching with qr codes on lamp posts. get to the factory by taxicab. initiate a bunch of bachelors.eat halal mix grill. learn that urdu script is similar if not identical to arabic.finish in time and uber to the train station towards kbv. walk to the hotel. check in then hit the sand for a speed game. get filled with joy for the simplicity of beach life. get back and get charged a ridiculous price for a shitty burger.
