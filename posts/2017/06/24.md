Title: SILVER LINING
  
schleep bad again. add nutella to oats. iron. get out on a free run. get soaked and punished by the wind, but get an alright pace. schleep the afternoon away. replenish with tororojo and pizza with the walkers and the boy. consider next years winter trip. swear at spotify connect. get told off by the adults for DAMN. and switch to kent instead. ig someone else’s pic, write a cryptic text like “meanwhile in the rabbit’s world, marlboros swim and giddamnit sausages cause indigestion”
