Title: APRON
  
powder brekkie, shaken not stirred. meet an old buddy then mistake a seat by a gate and sprint on final call on account of apron. quick detour through the electronics duty free to do the inevitable. grab and discuss new birds that deliver babies. multitask with the consultants and get baffled and irritated. let walt wait and promise things hard to fulfill. travel on a half empty train and make time disappears through coding.
**[ [a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn2fYdYy3G0) ]:** misbegotten (stonerror)
