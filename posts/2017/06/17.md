Title: TITANIUM
  
get blue jabs. witch grind stuff for pancakes. harvest weed at sixteen. collect proof of gridlock engraved in poland. feast on a kebab salad. kick start migoel aka dizazbut make a poor choice of route. pay the price of zero carbs and hangover. follow the black-red bike around the lake remotely. paint the liver red with beetroot. hot tub the soreness.
