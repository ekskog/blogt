Title: HIMSELF
  
beat the **alarm** by two minutes. greet **endless** rain. lose trains of **thought** completely. evade traffic by zig-zagging through the **projects**. arrive in time and consume veggie **juices** before anyone else. make a Â **deal** with ahata. contradict **headquarters** many times. predict a total **meltdown** for connected devices. bite nails with **boredom**. expedite the **keynote** then do the interval thing in the (**endless**) rain. **assemble** the bruceness at wagamama.
