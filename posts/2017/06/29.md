Title: XMAS IN HO CHI MIHN
  
wake up and hit the groceries shop. watch the goals from last night’s cup. do the oats routine on ewelina’s mom’s kitchen. wait for minionki to wake up and try to do some labour, give up on account of colonialism. do it like the yankees and spend quality time bargaining in galeria riviera. acquire new cycling shoes by shimano at half price.wait for g2 to decide on a follow no follow. take the bus and arrive before g'eazy. move to the tent for some second rate indie pop, exit tent left towards alison, who gorgeously hit the tom toms. run back for the tent ethnic party with a detour for falafel salad, polish style. get soaked with teens on old hits. top up with tororojo and go for a bit of kung fu rock showmanship. jump the queue when alone. buy energy bars at carrefour express.
