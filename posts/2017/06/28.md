Title: OPEN'ER
  
land ho. consider uber, get a normal cab, get the full tour from eweina. talk to chafia, pretend she knows more than you. go out and look for food and exchange paper for wristbands. queue with the much younger crowd for about an hour. feed the boys and kill time until open'er.talk to the colonialist and end up with a turned up stomach. get into a super crowded bus and endure a traffic jam. miss james blake on account of lazy companions and a catwalk show. catch a bit of sister lemonade but find it very boring and sophisticated. move to the main scene for the main attraction. disappear within the crowd and reach extasis while g2 gets confused with musique concrete. miss the second encore while the minionki hit the hip tent.
