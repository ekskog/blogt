Title: CEMENT AND ORE
  
**wait** for two hours. then leave and miss a god-daughter-made **smoothie** for five minutes. take four hundred ess and practically open **procedures**. try to give abhas™ a **chance** but take over after two minutes. then make the way to the **cement** factory and talk about the need for a change in the definition of job and wages. **conspire** to ruin the future of the next generation. or make it **utopian**. get luggage **locked** by a gypsy. be born again on his **bruceness** himself. then improve on g1 translation for the **duchess** daughter. **nothing** found so x equals one. somewhere someone runs on brand new green adidas **minimalistic** shoes. stuff it with almonds and watch **oxygen** disappear from a roomful of frequent travelers eating two hot dogs each. go for **lemon** water. rid of the old dishwasher. **sanitize**. 
**a tv show**: hand of god (christian propaganda)  
**[ [a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocn0gkJ2sMY) ]**: land animal (bent knee)
