Title: 25C
  
wage war on the weed that hands to the cracks on the stony hill. establish the tactics for final victory. unsore the tights by a peebee on the bike. then run super slow. printout boarding passes then convince the elder to soak old bones on the hot tube. get irritated but hopeful on another draw.
