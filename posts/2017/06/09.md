Title: TWO SÃ˜ LOOPS
  
wake the **rooster**. at four **forty** four. shake it and make it **double**. spin sixty nine love songs and **consume** more gas then usual. waste morning on **expenses** then lose concentration over thin voices and velour mini skirts. make good **impression** on colleagues of importance. go for the **loop**. start strong and regret the **chocolate**. consider **squatting** in the woods. endure. dream of **imosec**. explode then shower. get the **glass** pane no questions asked. and a flower that needs no sun. get the last of the family to **complete** half a centure.
**[ [a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8JuG6nRhb4) ]**: reno dakota (the magnetic fields)
