Title: WALKING IN THE RAIN
  
get the mood turned around by a skype invite from nina. arrange for water-falling on monday. ignore the rain and learn a lesson on neighborship through umbrellas. take the fast train to lech’s home. walk around katasztrof and learn how to do the yugoslav pose. dispatch gru and dru minionki to open'er and go shopping with g2\. bargain on shimanos and a pull boy. get the pane of glass replaced by half price and savour apple beer at billy’s w.y.w. get thrown out of the bullet train and take the cata-corno instead. finish the day with piwo and jajecznica.
