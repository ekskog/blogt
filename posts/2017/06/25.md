Title: FIDGETS
  
emtpy the jacuzzi. meet nige for a long one and have him burst yet another tube. make it alright but shorten it for 30 minutes, rebuild the loung chair again. paint it white. hit the toy store for pool supplies, drop the jaw for the price of fidget spinners. get chocolate again. watch the rivals on a close game, swear at premiere and resort to the mac. watch the first half and totally give up on account of faqir.
