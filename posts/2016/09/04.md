Title: CHORES, LISTED
  
**{ tumble #175130282388 }**  
did most of what i committed to the white book, which was not a lot by any means. then watched jb4 and it was mildly interesting and mostly more of the usual. rounded up with deNiro as a fake blind medium unmasked by a non blind zero-cred real medium. pretty lame.
