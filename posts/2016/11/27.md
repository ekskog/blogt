Title: BODYWASH, CARWASH 
  
**{ 153937570248 }**  
**v1:** the first of the advent and an attempt to skip celebrations ended badly. with lots of washing and swimming. and finally able to be entertained without palpitations at the unfolding of the season  
**v2:** water all over me. followed by the obvious argument on cleaning versus fitness. and the improper disposing of microwaves in the dark. replacing something very good with lots of features by something crappier but twelve years newer makes absolutely no sense to me
