i am not entirely sure one can fall in love with someone from the very very past. for the first time. but apparently it can happen. to someone you know.

mental note: never bike on subzero without the shoe cover   dinner with the most likely to help, which apperantly found L.A.F.S. 40 years too late  
the singer who did the prince tribute told stories about drag, which was in the bike route, by happenstance
