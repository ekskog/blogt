Title:  ANALVEJ SEVEN
  
**{ 153810766658 }**  
**version 1:** a car or a train. then train. then they got so late that they decided to abandon all passengers 2 stations before my stop. that is what monopolies do. no apologies. just fuck off, customers. in dk there was the issue of a mismatch in cvs, which made my suspicions even stronger  
**version 2:** took a train for a day out in lyngby, the office is pretty impressive with lots of light. not very productive and with lots of railway peculiarities, including the unexpected stop at önnestad which completely collapse the schedule of the öresunds commuters
