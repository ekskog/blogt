Title: THE LONG WAY HOME
  
Title:# ( rambling ntiyhie10k1uexhnw1o)  
  
so you think you are a **romeo** and stay awake while everybody crashes on trains and airports.  
an **airport** is not exactly a good place to lose a passport. **remember** that.  
sadly i realize that all those years of **service** has made me immune to traveling.  
would someone find a use for the **cavalera**â€™s biography i left on the 747? even if it is in **portuguese**?
