we did never finish discussing the **topic** around carbon-jelly. until the **vicarage** of slough made it **imperative**, that is. and **inevitably** we closed the chapter. slough, **plough**, tough. the vicar of slough will run for **president** of the cricket club.  
flights got delayed for no reason and minicab driver found **appropriate** to advise jin™soon, the **adversary** from marsèille and irene™ about nodejayess.  
it **rained** all day. and the insulation is **prime** brittish class  
until next time, **elowen**…no, wait! there is still time for polish **rice** noodles.
