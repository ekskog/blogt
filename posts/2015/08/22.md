Title:# ( rambling nti3sjamwc1uexhnwo1)
  
_(on the other side of the world)_ coming back from the **races**, i totally freaked out. bottle after bottle of **champagne** talking shit with the ladies, when i wanted to **drink** beer and talk with the guys. they told me i should put on **cheeks** 'cos they would make me look much nicer, even recommended a doctor who is very good with **injections**.  
_(on this side of the world)_ the janitor of **lunacy** saved a great deal of money by finding the right light **switch**.
