**L:** if chuck was right humans will soon develop a sense of **radar**. so we can continue to look into data **feeds** in small screens without bumping into each other. this could also be done as a **business** idea. we **isolated** some gene in bats and **splice** into our babies.  
**H:** apparel with **proximity** sensors that detect obstacles and then, via inductance, transmit **telemetry** information back to a central receiver that is directly embedded and **connected** to the humans brain and that controls our body.  
**L:** you are for **cybernetics** providing human augmentation. myself i vote for bio engineering for changing the core. it is all a **matter** of in what layer do we apply the change. you need to read **harari  
H:** what about this one. the **planets** ice shelves etcetera are melting so modifying humans to be **amphibious** and breathe under water or modify our ability to **submerge** for 60 mins like a whale would allow the human race to live longer on the planet as the **oceans** reclaim it
