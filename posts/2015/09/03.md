got evicted from my corner for giving **headaches** to the russian. “that’s a bad sign. there’s nothing worse than a label” on schild’s **ladder**.  
contrary to the law of **dharma** we are totally irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. we are only relevant in the micro scale of our relationships. so there are many subprojects to the grand project of the universal machinery?  
dharma is not real, **shawarma** is and i am hungry.
