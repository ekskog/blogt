before the beer got too old we took to a garden party. the wind could not get too us as the bushes were still alive. we learned about benin city and the role of fela kuti in nigeria. the ferry sailed the polish back to gdynia, we went to inaugurate filet™s apartment. was it klɛptə(ʊ)ˈmeɪnɪə or an accident? i guess we will never talk about it.
