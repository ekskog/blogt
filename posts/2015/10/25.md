Title:# ( rambling nwxh9dFXXK1uexhnwo1 )  
  
chief/thief/grief: who ate the **woods** with boy? we are on track like a **maglev** or a cossack without his horse some days. other days it is like **teflon** coated. the **kitchen** staff will go nuts, they are vietnamese and not akin to **liking** of the french.  
the door to the **scooter** shed ended up worse than the tower of pisa. let me **advise** everyone to never ever hire me as a carpenter.
