Title: FORTY TWO AND CHANGE
  
Title:# ( rambling pg7pt4K2Kf1uexhnwo)  
  
very early on a taxi then a bus westbound. in the corrals, a tall barefeet dude and an old dame in unfancy garments.  lots of gatorade on plastic bags. techno playing very loud inside the tunnel after the first tough climb. legs that refuse to run on the vidigal slopes. then rendezvous with the family at posto onze. overtaken by dame on thirty two, overtaking at thirty six. overtaken at forty. just a few minutes above four. kisses and medals.  
in the evening realising that climbing down stairs can only be done backwards.
