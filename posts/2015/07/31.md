Title: THE BUILDING OPPOSITE
  
Title:# ( rambling ntqgcalQGj1uexhnwo1 )  
  
the **street** we grow up had very bad rep for the multiple car **body** shops. i hid its **location** from xupeta™ until i could no longer do it.  
it is now a street-art **gallery**. and it has a micro-**brewery** too.  
at night it was time to **confabulate** with the first™godson around **sugarcane** spirits. he went on **hunting** immediately after we had a summit with bob™.
