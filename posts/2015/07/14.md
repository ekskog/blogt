swedish **stamp** design is mighty neat. we once recorded a **mixtape** and had lots of fish on the cover and called it “**ghoti**” (which you can pronounce “fish”).  
it would have been the second release of the zen **arcade**. one day someone will find that mixtape and make us all hyper famous, **posthumously**.  
we are now legally entitled to return to the land of my **ancestors**.
