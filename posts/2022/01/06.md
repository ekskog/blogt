Title: A PLACE TO MOURN
  
∆720 ∆759 :: tries to ascertain : the ownership of the base layer :: but first the ten goals : scored by the juniors :: removes devices from #E™s : then fiddles with sd cards :: inuit almost assembled :: the annoying problem of reality : binary spectrum :: buckwheat for a run : that turned into a sunray collecting walk :: inuit assembled : and shipped :: two sandwiches : because six and bump :: then xmas pizza : and no salt on the dough :: **don't look up** : is mostly a documentary
