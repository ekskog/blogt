Title: STEAMPUNK
  
∆729 :: the reoccurring bleam : this time on taxis : and apps that won't work :: demystifying vikings : by the tar in the horns :: debugs power supplies : and rotates lcd screens :: adiprene : for seven : because wet roads :: then does the trail : and gets five hundred  visconti™ : and the jagged walls :: joint efforts : makes better dinner :: sixty degrees : pig meat : with roasted potatoes :: then vanilla : macadamia :: too many screens : forces better choices : interrupted :: • : resumed
