Title: BAD ASS
  
∆659 :: bleams with bad maths : seventy people : makes fourteen not seven : or ten teams :: onomatopoeia : rhabdomyolysis : on guiness book :: then it is pancakes : with nutella : because the hill is steep :: and again the woop : is a lot of chicks and #delftie™ leading the way :: a half shite sauna experience : at fifty degrees : because some idiot left he door open :: lots of z: on account of more strain ::
