Title: THE TRAIL, FROZEN
  
âˆ†706 :: no freezing today : so fire :: finds about css outline : then forgets it :: documents : for an inventory :: how to be : a good cellular citizen :: segues into : a short swim session :: account planning : of absolute no use :: tratamtologist : for tennis elbow :: forensics on dormant accounts : and then cancels skype number :: finds meeksoda : at soundcloud :: retires tororojo : uses coffee on smoothie :: monomaniacally manipulated : to the ant farm :: but first : a dark trail run
