Title: BRACKETS FOR CURTAINS
  
∆626 :: out with nestle demo : in with central :: real pancakes : are easier to grädda :: rainchecked : by cop :: on account of overtime : and bad sleep :: so removes the south island loops : for twelve only :: the apparition : of the bare chested runner :: apex predators : half of it :: with a break : a failed attempt : to put up the curtains :: the second parts : is actually an improvement : on kirbyrism : albeit the agenda being pushed :: moves from the nestle experiment : into central :: then the final : of the spanish supercup
