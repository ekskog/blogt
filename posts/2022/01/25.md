Title: TWIN TOWERS
  
∆212 ∆613 :: rogan or young : never both :: sources for _tango sierra_ : for free :: the great filter : and the aestivation hypothesis :: still the taxman : takes more then delftie™ keeps :: roast : prams : sarin : **sugar** :: all the aggro : a bad app can bring :: swims : five hundreds : then intervals :: interrupted : by her errands : and a webcam :: plenty of parking : now all shopping is online :: code review : and subsequently a clean up :: lots of edge : for two uninterrupted hours : for the miners :: the asphalted paradise loop : is five hundred meters short
