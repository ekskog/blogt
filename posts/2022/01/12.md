Title: BACKYARD ULTRA
  
∆600 :: cycle stealing : whirlwind style :: ibrachina : capibaribe :: a lot of bleam : or rather a long one :: in estonia : on a strange experiment : dressed in white :: meeting a young footballer : on his way to gávea :: then late for a u2 gig : entering the very small venue : and deciding not to buy a t-shirt :: some goggins inspired : quads stretched :: segues into sequel : a  struggle for #D™ and #E™ :: backyard ultra : two laps : sill four hundred too much :: no pasta : beans then :: it all falls into place : with no explanation or logic : whatsoever :: the next phase : for the nespresso house :: right time this time : so got spin : and counted for wakim™ :: then a hard brick : with xyelm™ :: collecting the orange goat : on the former polish corner shop :: then it is malvadeza™ time : and in the break : get the cloud gateway endpoint to work
