Title: NOT KILLING, PART ONE
  
∆321 the howling wind ∆649 :: undermined : in contrarianism :: all the stuff the wind displaced : and then the big gas grill :: metabolism trackers : and flickering detection :: furonto misshon : and the vativision ::  reference 2qwiv5hl : merely an acolyte of the past :: inca mixed down : and a sleeve for america :: while half heartedly : penning a connect :: an outrageously expensive : electricity bill :: agata non : poteva macare :: jogs : nurse™spin : jogs :: in the end : corruption pays off
