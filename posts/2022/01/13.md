Title: TEAM SHOES
  
∆702 : the cut-light : of vini™malvadeza :: opens the orange goat : as it fits : dispose of the boxes ::  gets gardena sorted : without german help :: the issue with silicon : and pandemic supply lines :: beard stub : is apparently a thing in the pays-bas :: the need for a sausage factory : and email screenshooting :: three laps : on a slightly modified loop :: sequential computing : thingworx style :: barath buffers : with herb groves :: out wit futemax : in with futemix : but first : tabata : then bump
