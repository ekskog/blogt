Title: SCREENSHOTS
  
∆619 :: all the goals from the aspirants : while winds storm :: makes room for neato : by ironing ::  shoots screens : for sales graphs : because laz y execs :: gets coaching : serbian style :: then teaches puig™ : and the xfitter™ :: but in-between : four laps :: too much of berna fodder : bread included :: the walkers walk : to timout : while we took spermafläcken :: and in the end : lauren might have died
