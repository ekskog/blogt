Title: RECOVERY
  
∆747 :: what is the secret of running faster :: lemur begin defer paste :: the exact age of the milky way give it take :: tries to get a ticket using coins and get a finger from an imbecile instead :: plans for a long and slow recovery walk that does not involve stairs :: no delftie™ does not need to understand shit :: all the strange sex shops at pigalle and the amarican tourists at montmartre :: since it didn't rain takes the long way down to the river :: stops by chez moliere to admire the populace then settle for deliciousness by thai :: through marat to get a reality chock on the price of leather bags and other luxurious goods :: finds stripped tops for both at another no label store :: then up to de gaulle and further northeast quite uneventfully and without the need for coffeine
