Title: NEIGHBORHOOD GOSSIP
  
∆707 :: thinking it was already monday :: gets blackdot reward anyways :: more alkalinity and more _papa hotel_ and then ironing to kod :: autograh embedded novichok :: after the huns came the avars :: the bad totally devoid of swimmers allows for flip turns :: gets home in time to feed her and attempt to rescue from binging :: then at the agreed time for thresholds with kop™ she decides to go for a walk :: does the thresholds all the way to seventeen then explains the theory behind it :: there is football but it is of the not so very interesting kind
