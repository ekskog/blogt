Title: INHALE EXHALE
  
∆656 :: the need for civilkuragelag :: how does one censor the hydraweb :: despite rumors of mutiny we still beat crystal effortlessly :: almost misses the asthma nurse on accounting of the bluebirding on the porcelain throne :: makes it with one minute to spare :: blows on a tube that makes nice graphs then pump salbutamol then blows again :: visits the red village branch of the wellness consortium but the spinning bike was crap :: spins slowly at the main branch while talking capitalism with krona™ the taxi driver :: useless meetings that shoulda been better qualified :: two albums that are ridiculously long because of the format it was committed to :: malvadeza™ and karim™ fockyeah
