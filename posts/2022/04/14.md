Title: COMFORT
  
âˆ†540 :: then some brekkie wuw the cabbie parked outside the other hotel :: forty minutes waiting for the fog to lift but still on time for some swimming despite a sore right shoulder :: the root of all evil is surplus and people who want to tell others what to do :: goes fetch #2 from the train station then do her errands :: a nap manually registered :: error messages from malfunctioning wimshurts machines :: maussly putting it as double circumpolar morphology under the aegis of sedna and prolix polonius :: garments for the girls nothing for the boys :: gets ham and over-processed potatoes because good friday :: then lasagne as the emptying of the left-overs continue
