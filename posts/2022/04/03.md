Title: THE FINISH LINE
  
âˆ†650 :: after a ridiculous night of shit sleep with bolibrusco and awful dreams :: of course nothing can pass through the wall of nausea :: which led to a distinguished crash after twenty five :: therefore no repeating rotterdam performance :: the fact that the frogs were only serving water and no isotonic helped too :: and the medal is appallingly ugly and the smaller sizes t-shirt were all but gone :: make the way back to saint dennis painfully with all the stair climbing :: then of course there was no hot water on the hotel :: kebabs delivered via uber eats and a denial to sit at the restaurant :: rounded up with jamaican gansta crap
