∆521 :: naïvely collecting : beautiful sounds :: aya baya : mondrian : cowboys : farmers :: miles : cigar : biffy : ultra scene :: attempts compressions : while juggling publishers : in contemplation of the absurd :: fakes overlapping meetings : as excuses for procrastination :: the warm feeling : of having evaded the taxman :: krsna and nacelles : and how comes no one knew : this was all about renewables :: the health house : rainchecks on the call :: do the bloody burpees :: a change of cook : and the lamb was too spicy : and the chai shite :: the really crap service : on old kincrawn
