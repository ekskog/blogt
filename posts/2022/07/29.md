Title: STARING AT THE SEA
  
âˆ†627 and only thirty seven percent on account of no dreaming :: lots of preparations and manipulations and gimping of wordle and xingu dalles :: fear of flagellating oneself in public blows goats :: music unsets and upsets as they run out of words :: manages to solve all issues julian had and so gets called legendary :: mission shift mrs smith and mojo wants to monetize podcasts :: gets better at fixing flat tires but still takes the car to ring island and gets the last remaining parking slot :: lots of bike supplies then triathlon meds and beer :: segues into kebab salad and the hammock :: rounds it off with overnight prep
