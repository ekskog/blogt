Title: SIBELIUSTALO
  
âˆ†632 :: happy new year and it is pretty quiet :: packs and decides to bring felt to office :: twenty two minutes wait for an uberx ::  convenience and agility done but next time pay attention at the questions :: fool around with time signatures because porcupine tree :: caterings to the quadrophonic sophisticates :: leave the surface on the room and get one from amzinstead applying the discount :: wind farms and heat tunnels :: the hotel happens to be next door to the train station :: the usual struggle with the mechanics but assembled in a zen manner :: gets a kss race license and possibly a place in the team :: the village shrinks and shrinks and the products get less interesting :: then gets some stuff for the rainchecker without explicit permission :: checks the bike and bags then get what must account for the worst gluten free pizza on the planet and cold too it was
