Title: THE ROOF
  
∆728 :: ninety eight now that is something :: miles plain liver :: goes outside and get dirty with reassembling the felt and cleaning the cleat :: in the meantime coffee gets brewed :: the ridiculous phone queue to the postal service and five minutes with elnono :: fiduciary’s juice raising concerns for data-exfiltration :: orders from power and decided to return the chinese silicon :: upon the roof for a soft pre-performance :: but first tries to bargain for a start on holmsjö :: then groceries in partnership and two ways to check out :: the moomin tin box of biscuits gets collected
