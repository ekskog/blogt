Title: PARQUE DAS RUINAS
  
∆710 :: unpacks surface and falke for later labor :: the instant carbohydrate gratification of the plantains :: an inverted pyramid of piffle :: suggests hercule™ should extend his exile tenure for a few more decades :: rauber-schoppa-bawhani and red nodes :: **[ [ moomin ]( https://daily.bandcamp.com/lists/the-moomins-feature/ ) ]** :: how many times must one charge the falke batteries :: gets through the whole of twenty twelve on blot :: interspersed with a visit from in-laws :: then out on an attempt to groom the evergreens slightly better with mixes results :: cover fingers with superglue and the are weirdly white :: goes for groceries to feed the party committee :: ships to wien without tracking for half the price :: soundtrack by harley caterpillar
