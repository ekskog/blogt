Title: VILLAGE PARTY
  
∆535 :: godddamned timezoned games and it was a scoreless draw :: lebensspuren :: more of these completely stupid and useless threads that are nothing but breadcrumbs of proof :: the rhythm of the business cadences and becoming the career enabling machine :: neither mares black witch nor bicycle patches :: no more engagements only opportunities :: people with strange surnames in sverige will always struggle but end on top :: vacaciones requested albeit slightly late ::  je répète, la marmite de l'ermite :: omelette then yoghurt with blueberries while trying to adx :: reaches out for a teutonic halfwit with expected results :: nothing really fits and it is because of delftie™ being a joker of course :: gets a new gas bottle and money refunded for unfit shit :: disturbing samples guaranteed to make you squirm ::  sylvain is in japan so everything is fluid :: poets stomp :: drive to nicksis on account of montmartre and gets eighty one percent :: shares the table with the nelsons™ including gabelito™
