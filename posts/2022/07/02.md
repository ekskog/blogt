Title: HERO'S HOUR
  
âˆ†726 :: now one percent is not exactly much :: honesty responsibility equity goodwill and explanations for them :: strep tread berth 
**route** :: norm ransk maito but gluten-free :: islands for maximal relaxation then try the water :: bad swimming strategy by starting at the back :: bike starts really well until no electrolytes then it is all hell :: tie suljettu and forest toilets trying not to be spotted and dsq :: the via dolorosa between station one and the two :: then cold gatorade saves the day :: no way one can stay for hero hour with all the mini mosquitoes :: a very strange line up that worked really really well
