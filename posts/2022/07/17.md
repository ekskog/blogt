Title: NOT IN CONVOYS
  
∆940 :: blackdot and way too much oats :: not the right weather for öland :: so join the police force on a swimrun of the inner islands :: seventeen degrees water and very consistent trail running :: segued into the price of food and a chance encounter with the duqs :: further into agreeing on a little game of padel :: executed swiftly and victoriously :: from nowhere there’s hope or the witty spoilers of imogen's gramps :: then of course there is a lot of food to eat :: like coleslaw and ratatouille and ice cream and cherries :: card quizzes to decide who will do the dishes :: a slim but real opportunity to get the mini epiphone to behave
