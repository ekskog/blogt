Title: APRONED
  
∆703 :: another one of those mood swings :: closes door and codes for hospital machines :: whilst acknowledging the ugliness in the world :: it turns out to be an async/await issue :: and we are back to an old crisis :: reflections observations and this could be the last year :: but then there is a train to catch and code won’t write itself :: a surprisingly deserted airport :: coleslaw ham eggs spicy wings :: bread holes bloke glove clone cheat :: stuff from tvplus to watch when airborne :: from twelvea to tenf on account of weight distribution :: honeyed nougat miracle is definitely an album or band :: which came about after an hour waiting for the electrical storm to recede
