Title: WHAT TOMORROW BRINGS
  
∆723 :: helps mirolito™ to choose a wetsuit ::  the gorilla supertape proves to be a good acquisition :: gets acquainted with the smile while claiming expenses :: a very obnoxious and random propensity model :: another thirty moved across the wire to pay for restaurant extravagances in rio de janeiro and also accounting for the inevitability of zero net salary :: india and another anonymous dudette on the back of the room :: quads responded pretty well so the were gifted k19 :: a quest for a small cardboard box led nowhere :: or rather led back to an empty ikea box at home reinforces with elephant tape :: booking engineering towards vaasa needs help from a simple agent :: that takes too long and therefore shipping postponed :: done with book #6 of joona :: checks in then lounges then realises there is thirty minutes to get to the zoo :: a real power walk that was totally unnecesary as of course there was a support act and the whole thing started at ten :: the chubby ex super skinny guitar god is now an harpist too ::sometimes it sounds like king crimson red with a whiney singer
