Title: REGERINGSGATAN
  
∆535 :: because the crew needed rest :: no cabs online so spermafläck :: mount barge :: pitstop at regeringsgatan for boris green tea and assorted shit with sugar :: no agenda lets just do whatever :: apparently nothing stick to the brain of the consultants :: whiteboards the shit out of them then :: all the different attempts at building for arm32 succeeds on target machine :: then a bunch of silly mistakes but in the end the end was reached :: a new pit stop for more sugary shit and how to hide successfully in the ranks of the mothership :: ärtsoppa no pancakes nachos instead :: violence information and charisma :: drives meyertz™ to door on account of an opportunity to virtually spin with saskia :: food close to bed time and quite a lot of dates
