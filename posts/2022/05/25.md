Title: THE ISRAELI STUDIO
  
∆724 :: a confirmation of zero neto salary :: another frango conceded by jersey forty five :: beirut or istanbul :: morse tough couch :: all sorts of preps for lunch on account of spinning with saskia™ and some born in eighty two by cube :: a retryable error occurred :: works on getting a good flow for the shipbuilders and it goes smoothly :: then gets the lawn a good haircut and it counts as a workout :: gets to the old beerhaus for some israeli skills and it proved to be a lot of fun :: complements it with a few hundreds on the pool and it was quiet but hard :: thoughts and fucking prayers
