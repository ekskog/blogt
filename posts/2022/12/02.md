Title: THE MUDTRAILS
  
∆723 :: not enough _seepeeyous_ :: once willingly declined a spiritualized **threesome** :: susulevado™ big ass muthation from ciudad hornbæk ::  sheer robe hand-woven uplifting and motivating so quit your nine to five :: cathartic  **tersely** tilted :: then out for four dot six strain on muddy pinr :: the physical pleasure felt by scratching **graphite** on paper :: aguante la milonga y alcatra and still sent home early by the south koreans :: parlour games for indolent **poseurs** :: then a fry up including salmon :: an hour of no goals is all that she can stand :: and it could have gone either way including a clash with the colonists :: and then labatut closes it with a **lemon-tree** metaphor
