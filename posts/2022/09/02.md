Title: FLEMINGSGATAN
  
∆609 :: a volleyball hall for the girls varsity in southern mississippi :: alas the attic datacenter now runs ranchers :: æthelstan of wessex and his capital city :: gets reminded that delftie™ knows very little of _aypeeeye_ management :: remember to always at least look for portal changes :: asks all the right questions to the partners and as such collects employment tokens :: proposes mo™ suggestion of recording raw :: the proper attire for a celebration in the capital city :: the amur annexation and the way everything is going to shits ::  packs for two on samsonite then drives the black one :: delayed but lands on time :: first meet with svetl requires yellow cab to town :: then to old town and little karachi where the appetizers were much better than the main course and everything chickpeas :: walks to t-centralen to get rid of bloating
