Title: UNDER THE BRIDGE
  
âˆ†638 :: the snafu of data privacy hamlet style :: minimumu insertion after trying to locate the other loops on strava :: opens the box of beets but the voice is not final o no sir :: the felt gets a nice clean for the first time ever :: and so everything goes into the bike case :: attempts napping before bad but unsure how it went :: the first cay was so fast it must be a garmin error :: the second was a race against a chinese boy :: then extends the run and finds the correct strategy only to panic over closing hours :: manages to sneak in but of course forgets the bluehokas after disciplining syrian teens :: bakes half a pig while watching almost all the rest of bat cat interrupted for soma :: the keys were in the left cleat
