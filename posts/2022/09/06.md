Title: SOMEONE ELSE'S SKULL
  
∆451 :: niemira’s nose :: a liberal hipster yet to grow a beard or develop a taste for quinoa :: l'un des plus élégants témoignages :: can’t really connect to arc and it becomes the struggle fir the day :: until substituted by repurposing the old fujitsu :: but all of that has to wait because there us un-pirating to be done at a high cost :: chats with pinja™ and decides to add a new subscription to junkyard for a discount on yōkê :: epic fail on banana cake on account of trying almond flour :: then swims or rather tries not to get tangled on evil algae in installments of one hundreds :: and with a leaky pair of speedo goggles :: only the elite at the gated paddle court and doubles it with the teen for a lot of defeat
