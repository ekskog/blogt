Title: TWENTY FIVE
  
∆643 :: quarter of century for #1™ :: no red wave then _effelay_ and _tango x-ray_ :: pretty much and all these other stuff and things :: successfully breaks the iot-proxy out :: standardize on standards and two step strategies :: strap crane :: merkle trees are super efficient :: perfectly spherical cows of uniform density on a frictionless surface :: than more maths and all is covered :: runza bit over five in taper mode with the rat and the lady toad :: then runs the hub agent in k3s :: demethylation phenomenon on bristlecone pines
