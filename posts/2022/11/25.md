Title: SCALING UP THE E22 
  
∆652 :: the **taxman** seems to have forgotten delftie™ :: which means there’s money for sooner or later your own self will always catch up :: cui™yang wants to borrow my git handle :: does the **clerical** job which becomes delftie™s burden for at least the end of the year :: while fiddling further with ingress :: inspiring_rhodes stupefied_mclean for noderedisapp :: drivez her to the bus stop to catch the five hundred east :: **pit-stop** on the way back for ice cream thaneatz thee whole thing while watching cymru disintegrates :: with profanity and a quivering voice in the style of a greek **theoxeny** :: kind of figurezout then not it is rocket science where the rocket to mars is being built en route :: tread-milling for an hour is pretty hard even while **streaming** a game :: so rewarded with junk food and a long wait :: burn evidence of said dinner
