âˆ†525 :: heb je zin om te neuken :: very poorly **pollinated** cucumber :: createz devvm because l33t is showing aging signs :: no edge on mini iso and please don't try to **reproduce** on the simulator :: pourzanswers on spreadsheets :: slowlymakez sensee of rocket science with deployments **persistence** and balancing load :: while running two experiments in parallel, both failing but allowing to collect important logs :: the art of parroting or how to build architectures by listening to **youtube preachers** not machine builders :: chicken kebab to the rescue :: another attempt of a polarized zero drop run succeeds but on a slow pace which is the whole point :: a million **scovilles capsaicin** oil in a mister
