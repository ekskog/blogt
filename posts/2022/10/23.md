Title: THE SIDE EXIT  
  
∆646 :: the rabbit wooded with a header from the jewel and a typical **onion strike** :: considerz bun then typescript :: not even ten and kitchen duty for the week cleared :: but first chlorella and oatmeal :: train slope mucky muddy :: out for a **podrenod** around the island :: the gunditjmara people’s creation story, the last time budj bim erupted and the oldest story ever told :: thenupgradez thee **carving tool** and why not while in a shopping spree two years of proton pro :: nothinclingz toto life like **thorn-bushes** but delftie™ swiftly wages war on them :: information error correction and everything but **neutrinos** :: more done with colorful quinoa then an açaí smoothie and two raw bars for the road :: the usual idiot on the tracks led to disconnecting the power :: the peripheral on the silver screen is **ridiculously** amazing
