Title: GOING HOME
  
∆500 :: a whole night of uneasy sleep and still some hyper realistic bleams :: can’t do oatmeal with glazed oats so **corno-flacos** and imodium :: experiencez the usual tummy whirlwind :: the mexican bike gear extravaganza to add totally unnecessary stress :: very incorrect **strategy** leads to a disastrous swim and very crowded buoy turns :: the cycling went way better than expected despite the extra evil surprise climb and the head wind toward mataró :: a cautious first lap almost ruins the sub six strategy but two **maurtens** and lots of water saved it :: a proper _peebee_ deserves a agood massage and paella rice :: mirolito™ does it too and with a strong run :: perro™muerto gets a _deeessqueue_ for three small minutes on the middle sea ::  the lack of a proper access to bike and bags retrieval :: cuban recovery drinks a la fidelito :: very good packing and **assembling** until complete exhaustion hits :: no taj no burger joint so kebab :: mylo™ the bike caddy deserves two estrelas
