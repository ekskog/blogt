Title: TAKE MY PROBLEM  
  
∆703 :: raining pero **non troppo** so light run to check the state of the blood pump :: gina and getting late in taking a problem to the united nations :: there is logitech mouse that **announces** itself as triathlon :: the challenges of the embargo countries and **satlinks** :: then lots of talk and one slide :: no gluten free options at the canteen so it is a crappy mushroom broth :: but excellent mixture of ethnicities with one kyrgyz, two burmese and a nigerian :: an early exit perfectly timed with time for a crappy burger :: at the **juncture** of real trauma and real systemic failures :: all the black cows at the göinge pasture eating at the same time :: osterberg de la salle :: twelve crowns is the current rate for a lift from the train station :: (jumping jack) flash fault splendid
