Title: ALL CONS MOD
  
∆730 :: head on collision with an orange truck and pledging not to die must count for a very scary bleam :: coder money woven :: deploys minikube and it actually works first time on elite :: gets lost in learning but is hijacked by healthineers :: and it was hard to debug but delftie™ was right :: not exactly a hero but at least not a total noob :: plot with electro-domestics and engine-makers :: sir nit sur it has been retired so deal with it:: the _exvee_ is fully insured so drive to the red village and the traffic is ridiculous :: no other swimmer so go hard and see results :: no time for eating as there is padel to play :: wins all but one game and get mobbed for it :: potato dal with noodles nah :: fetches #2™ from bergåsa and make a pitstop for a burger
