Title: UP POPPED
  
∆655 :: stiff on account of tone and peperf so kassie :: then joins midjourney dischord after fixing @attic :: an adrenochrone implant for the rude girl :: books saskia changes mind on account of picnic :: gets grilled bird and batata and ölkorv :: also pays for a bikini bottom :: no parking near the salt island beach :: on account of clearest water around :: so it is an ultraje at the beach moment minus the farofa and the little vitrola :: jumps gracefully from three :: follows saskia hard on climbs then pushes on treadmill but is humiliated by some random dude :: empty the leftover stock before gathering at the fish square :: discussions around group dynamics and growing up with drugs :: powered by too much free alcohol
