Title: 3KM SHORT
  
∆704 :: up and no data as it is long run day :: fuels up with watermelons :: take the inner route to river besos and then back via the coast :: two pitstops for showers and it is impossible to maf in this heat :: respectful enough breaks at eighteen as no more isotonic :: books a vehicle for free minus taxes :: out for eggs and quinoa and more watermelon :: repurpose tandoori’s left overs :: walks to the shops taking a different road :: no make up for her and rip curl bermudas for delftie™ :: bici through small alleys packed with tourists :: then açai with a million added calories :: all sorts of very ugly humans exposing flesh :: the incredible group of people flexing outside desigual :: spanish potatoes make the best fries ever
