Title: THE SOUTH
  
∆735 haptically on green :: ridiculously long bleams with flowers™ :: gets the rental and then waits for the truck to turn and almost fall a tree :: it is rather easy to get out if the city :: a mighty mighty rain that could easily be climate change but all gone in thirty :: walks in tarragona for the amphitheater and tapas :: the usual shitty service and bad food at playa mayores :: as it happens we drove south but waikiki is north and we ignored the driving app :: a long and hard hike goes undetected by the whoop but not by the camera :: a most beautiful cove with warm sea that looks a lot like geelong :: how to get lost in the train and therefore cut it down to one fifth :: back on voice only and apple’s navigation is so much better than evil’s :: how to get refunded for the fuel and then walks home for a large padthai in a box :: done with suspicions
