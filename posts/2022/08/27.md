Title: BLACK FIBER FOR FARMERS
  
âˆ†645 :: decides to cancel peperf on the account of afternoon chores :: heads towards the red village and the legs feel very very heavy :: then drops a bottle and stop to retrieve it :: about two minutes or so slower to reach the yellow creek bridge where first maurten is consumed :: all the hunting towers assembled in preparation for the season to start :: recover some pace on the downhills to the creek of tor :: pauses for a wee and realizes the aerobars are loosening :: continues to salleryd and does emergency bike mechanics with a pink rituals band :: does the uphills of flyeryd absurdly well which gives a rather nice final average pace :: black spots commonly seen on maple leaves are a fungal disease caused by the rhystima acerinus fungus :: break poser timer gluer nuder phew :: then to the beach which slowly but surely gets filled with infants and elders :: no one wants to cook so a dog-tv chicken is acquired and consumed but it was not enough :: empties a bag of chia nachos while watching the gunners second half :: and of course doing the hieroglyph whatsapp thing with brazilians
