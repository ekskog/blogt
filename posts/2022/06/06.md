Title: FLAG DAY
  
∆702 :: spark mount bloom :: why have delftie™ not document the discovery trick :: washes the front deck but there is rain :: the wonderful feeling of a trimmer that just works :: finish of lazarus and with that kepler liina is done for now :: the harvested dandelion was pretty bitter but the chicken patties were fine :: adds _tango foxtrot alfa_ to the tenant and voilà the cloud services are game :: then push the lawnmower hard as the cable has snapped :: pain patrol getting boring weird :: skips krav as legs still tight :: too many metaphors to increase the word-count of the dantzari dantza :: gives the lincoln lawyer a chance
