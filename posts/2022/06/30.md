Title: BECAUSE SUMMER
  
∆449 because ibagué :: which ended surprisingly well but caused awful recovery :: tread point stuck butch mutch which resolves to tires or boats ::  more surfing for mounts and there is one on the lahti outlet how convenient is that then :: there is uber in helsinki but it is just normal taxis :: timezone screwups and an opportunity for hoarding stickers :: and of course taking pictures of streetart and tampa de bueiros :: the part time receptionist with arrival symbols tattoo :: one-in-a-milijan™ arrives late and so we go straight into lunch which was not ärtsoppa :: lots of talk and bonding which is very useful :: resists the strong desire to nick the surface headphones :: get three protein bars and flavored water :: manage to order the mount using the proper zip code :: only to be informed that due to inconsistent stock management they don’t have it :: lots of walk to catch vitamin d to try to sleep better :: ruins it with artificial light in bed
