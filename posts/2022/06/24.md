Title: EQUINOXED
  
∆729 :: then four one nine throttled while trying for coupons :: spite while maize brine :: books carspect then makes every repo private :: pieces of vulcanized emotional shrapnel :: keto brekkie because the lawn will not mow itself :: to consulte one’s own genius :: rearranges furniture after all it is the summer equinox :: done with mickey and maggie :: attempts to watch the traditional celebrations blocked by lack of parking spaces :: ends up eating monster ice cream with the polish crowd :: chops veggies for the boulabaisse then adds apple :: before the månsson posse the sixteen :: it is midsummer so aquavit and little water and impromptu snapsvisor om putain :: after the feast and the cake robe cycling to brown waters :: the commie punk does the djing until taxi so there's madness train on the lawn
