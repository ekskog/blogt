Δ800 : a split second before her alarm :: float grief defer **refer** :: just a quick one with kyiv then some expenses and photo uploads :: procrastinatezuntil commitz to mow **the lawn** :primez tooo much and drown the carburator in gasoline : but at least  the lesson was learned : **the price paid** was an awful stink :goez thehe full distance with fins and the pace was shit still : and of course the garmin® was forgotten so double visit to bridge :: so late lunch as **the weather** seems to be improving :: good weather and nothing to do at work means delftie™ can learn about the copenhagen interpretation of reality : which is actually mind-blowing : or who was **the observer** at the big bang :: getzinstructed to catch up on a tv show only it was the wrong one : both being britcrim : one in wales the other in ireland :: blackshore s01e01-02
