∆704 :: float share shape shade **shame** :: escapez**chaperoning** to @corcovado and goez for a css instead at the very last lane :: pretty lame results but maybe coros® was the culprit :: still rewarded with **cheese bread** before left overs :: the young came for lasagna and then we agreed on a visit to the city center :: the @solerón steps were fantastic but it got very dark very fast :: snapshots of **macumba** but no cathedral :: agreezon adão but it was closed so @academia for **little hiddens**
