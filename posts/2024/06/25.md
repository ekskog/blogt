∆551 :: aurora™ not borealis :: nada against **the rich coast** :: a right said fred wetsuit moment : only fatty not sexy :: then a clockwork moment when fixing the fixie® : where the tube had folded under **the valve** :: stuff done perhaps randomly and without any user needs gets axed by delftie™ :: ice cream while cumadi™ walks felix™ : before going back to the waterfront with zululetz™ :: float bravo **savor** :: but first attack confluence® like there is no tomorrow :: alignezon feedback kindergarten style :: getzonetwoone anticipated and still leavezat half past :: strangely easier to back to back spin : and get a middle eastern plastic bottle as a reward : unwilling gifted by **the previous owner** :: a bunch of people picnicking at **the patio** :: heats up jen™s leftovers then to rema1000® for a very cheap magnun® knock off :: rød og hvid through on discipline
