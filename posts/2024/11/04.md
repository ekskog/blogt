float tiler **title** :: 
makeZ chai forgetZ the chai :: 
driveZ to the surprisingly pre-paid inspection : which was remark-free : then giftZ delftie™ a **takräcke** ::
the product roadshow was actually quite nice :: 
a complete clusterfuck on **the two tera** on cocobox : when trying to re-pve :: 
no panic as yet as photorec® seems to do the job :: but it might take days :: 
some of **the files** were on coconas® :: 
a surreal gathering of morons on institutional customers :: 
a consultant on site that does not even try to do after sales :: 
pain death suffering and warren ellis™ :: 
out to see if **the knee** has healed : and it is always painful to run on the cable construction : trieZ to stretch the route but meh :: 
good news on the knee front ::
