∆438 ∆540  : bleams of forgetting the snowboard boots at the bottom of **the mountain** and not being able to get a cable car ticket on account of lenses and no reading glasses :: 
float paler value **halve** :: 
the hairy eighties : lolippoping galore :: 
bike first run back : and with **the tube** properly pressurized :: 
far too many meetings to be able to do anything useful : insult added to injury as no brazilians showed up for lunch :: prepone **the data boss** in good time for stage left :: 
then jogZ home and it was too short : which means plenty of time to shower :: 
dismantle : reassemble :: earZ two cheese sandwiches :: a big fan of bella-real :: the second half of the penguin s01e01
