[ [coop](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9y1somLTcZ2chZ91A) ]

Δ536 and green :: 
four on the south american turkeys :: 
float chart **grant** : noij™ got it in two :: 
very intense greeks on the road to burnout :: 
fr some reason the mac doesn't like to be kubeconfig'ed so take a nostalgia trip to azure® arc :: a futurist is actually a job and so is also a glucose goddess :: all good engineers are on pre-sales or they have gone solo :: 
feels definitely like a puncture but there is an air compression pump at the basement : and there are chinese goods to be collected at an instabox® : so take the christiania shortcut :: two epic fails on trying to shrink t-shirts :: 
makeza brazilian tortilla and a smoothie then code some but the rolling ball mouse is no good for marking text :: 
the first half of the penguin s01e01
