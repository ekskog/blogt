Title: THAI-ISH
  
[ [wokshop](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bKGaoJVE2HXmduMb7) ]

∆606 :: 
quiet as can be on account of snoring :: 
float flock floor **flour** :: 
kakao® is a seriously good donkey® :: 
**the agile kitchen** and jens™ the scrum master :: 
go2martin and other stuff that nobody would believe to be possible : the secret meetings they hold in **the secret hallways** : its like hogwarts this place :: 
kq™ now knows of warhol™ : and sunday mornings :: 
getting lectured on architectures by an accountant :: 
it was not a rubber fold it was a puncture :: 
out for thai in the rain and it was delish : but first silicone stuffs for the kitchen ::   
neeskens™ **the orange carousel** man goes up to meet fourteen™
