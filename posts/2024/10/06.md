whitedot :: 
then out for a comb and a toaster :: 
float panel baled laser **lager** ::
out to try to find oister® but no luck only lyca® :: 
she gets the organizing boxes she was looking for : but no **guaraná** :: 
1294 then abs and leg extensions :: 
with enough time to get some real mexican grub : and then there was a great idea of taking the mercedes℗ instead of donkey℗ :: 
good seating places at **the wrong side** when vision is concerned :: 
dry cleaning is an awful name for a band : and what a weird band it was :: 
it was like tele-evangelism live : with **the devil** or a least a demon on the violin and it was mind blowing
