Δ542 Δ702 :: 
whitedot :: 
then out for a comb and a toaster :: 
float panel baled laser **lager** ::
out to try to find oister® but no luck only lyca® ::

1294 then abs and leg extensions ::

good seating places at **the wrong side** when vision is concerned :: 
dry cleaning is an awful name for a band : and what a weird band it was ::
