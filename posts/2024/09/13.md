Title: WEIRD FACES
  
[ [schiphol](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gt3K1ethJ9j6c8J7A) ]

∆510 :: 
float crane ramps **harsh** :: 
not exactly because of **the game** but still :: 
the same odd goal and it was a single one and it was enough :: 
with green gloves for a very thorough clean up :: 
into **the office** for juice and this time no beets no pancakes :: 
fiddlez mostly with the impossible connection between exchange® and keychain on ventura® : inconclusively :: 
until it is time to take yellowfixie® slowly to **the airport** :: 
dinner is a poke bowl and a completely fake açaí sad story :: 
vikings s05e04-05 :: 
collected by konijn™ in his money printing machina :: 
early enough for a visit to his nonijn™ favorite coffee shop
