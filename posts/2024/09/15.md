oatmeal with nutella® because long run :: 
by car to team.nl because it is where **the race** starts ::
and it was weird with running one cay them jumping on a bus :: 
it was a trail but alongside to it there was a bike lane but choose **the sand** :: 
use bianca™ as a pacer even thought she had a slightly slower pace :: 
team rendez vous just underneath **the vietnamese tunnel** and it was low :: 
around the museum slash aid station delftie™ goes for cobras and ends up losing **the corded plugphones** :: 
then it gets a lot harder with climbs and shitty trails and mud and sand : so some walking uphill was inevitable :: 
couldn't find joseph's grave so left it on the current occupier of 2c-0014 :: epic fail on an attempt to find a shortcut so endure the whole thing :: 
float price cured recue **recur** :: 
**the bus** was hard to find but it fitted just about everyone :: 
the left knee is definitely bugged butwalkz too the argentinean steakhouse run by **the subcontinentas** for a nice steak
