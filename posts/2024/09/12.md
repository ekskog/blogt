∆601 :: 
float space brash **brass** :: 
early into office on an oportunity to onboard the macbook™ : which was missed on account of low battery :: 
to preapare oatmill using teawater works and even melts the chocolate ::  
up to the fifth for a completely brain mushing **appsteerco** including a lot of repetition : and lunch while you work :: 
a town hall in person so thecio™ can impress thecfo™ :: 
not much left in terms of brain power but actz like a boss on the last thirty :: 
there is an app to track **the aurora borealis** apperantly : and tonight it was over oslo but visible in amager :: 
the extra thing that chink™ sent by mistake was a tesla® gas pedal
