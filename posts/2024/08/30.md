Title: CALENDARS
  
[ [englandsvej](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YkBAfJyd7gXG8SUB7) ]

Δ446 and there was no getting back ||  
svetlana and her buddy then wash **the deecay** sneakers on the chinese bag ||  
a lot of discussion and bad vibe but no alternative so basically kids amok in **the candy store** || 
haahr™ **the klingon** war-queen and being assimilated by borg || 
alignz with a fraudster about another kind of and then lunch at desk || 
the usual walk'n'talk loop this time with a **timişoaran** thug deejay of sorts || 
free ice cream before it all melts away ||  
september does not have thirty one days ||  
by metro to **the triangle** to exchange the goods and even upgrade the cap which proved that losing sleep was a mistake ||
