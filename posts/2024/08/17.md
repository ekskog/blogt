[ [t1/t2](40b9a76e2483320434a2d5aed5eb9d1a) ]

Δ500 : ish || 
obviously unablez to down anything to an already churned stomach || 
pumpz**the tires** to one hundred andputz thee bottles in the cages || 
back to one more egg and swim gear || 
decidezon **the phelps®** which was only good and fog free for maybe one hundred meters ||findz flowow really quickly and leavez**the slow pack** behind || 
a fast transition and it was a fast ride until **the wind** killed all dreams of a peebee || 
get passed on the bend to the west side || 
the rest of **the ride** was a slow and steady ticking down of the average pace || 
the run started as planned but at around **the first hairband** it goes down as two fingers in the throat || 
and about one hour lost in trying to recover || 
with five hours to go a fast walk would avoid deeeneff || 
and with **the last lap** as a full jog heroes hour's was safely avoided |decidez tozto stay behind for food and massage || 
float mural lapis laned lanch **lanky**getz totzto see **the vojvodans** take the lead
