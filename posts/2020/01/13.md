Title: BALLROOM
  
two hours short of proper sleep :: fill the hour with the robinsons :: teach milou™ how to drive a peloton then the meaning of brick run :: **dua saleh** courtesy of sound opinions :: fresh underwear but not socks or a jumper :: the world congress of the ninjahood listens to yada yada :: my ve forward with the big carlo demo while time is just wasted in shite presentations :: be the nutrion police and be rewarded with weirdish sexual comments :: camomile tea instead of toro :: nothing of any real interest at the rack and of course no swim garments :: do swimming instructions and debate parenthood and measurement systems with a canadian :: the mary crowd the german posse conversations with budyk™ table curling :: the _alpha alpha_ delivers the vanished luggage
