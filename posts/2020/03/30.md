Title: CAN'T IGNORE
  
ginger shots esbitorox forte and tortilla chips with sea salt :: dismally testing the bridge between collaboration tools and firewalls :: that means no exchanges of daguerreotypes and alike :: we usually don't get up close and personal as we have been labelled quite reliably asocialists :: look into beets again just because there is procrastinating to be done :: try to yocto a pi4 because there will be no devkit from the batteries :: when the scripts fuck up ping emil™ :: fiddle with read only file systems until write is achieved :: put the door up with #2™ it is no sweat if done according to the fucking manual :: it snowed and looked cold for a while but there's a run to be done outdoors :: get on skype with emil™ then barrito™ and guailan-1™ will it be an exit strategy
