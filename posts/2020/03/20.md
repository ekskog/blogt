Title: MIRROR IN THE HALL  
  
one to ones with maximor™ are improving :: lessons on feedback and the difference between nagging and complaining :: video conferences where delftie™ hides the camera to save bandwidth :: the right stan smith was mysteriously in the trunk of the _x-ray vector_ :: a crash of erica saved by auto back up :: dodge the quarentena and go for a trail jog and feel all the better for it :: one pizza two pizzas documented and shared :: get half a load of salmon from fiskbilen then deliver one to the posse at aliz™ :: **so ya thought ya might like to go to the show** :: there is not enough frequencies to cast arnie and sarah over the air
