Title: ONETWOFIT AT THE ATTIC  
  
a liquid oatmeal with powders of difficult colours :: the motorcycle slash lawnmower factory needs automating and quickly :: the ugly thow away armchair becomes the office :: entertain an idiot and surely worse things follow :: as the office has new floors things get back inside :: right on time for wasting about and hour with clueless colleagues but get an epiphany or rather a coincidence on yuval surveillance society :: revive the old stationary bike from china and do a solid hour at her gh cadence :: cook again and again and will be always one more time :: mint tea with honey and the eno brothers to escape fucking stupid television :: done with keito and thaniel and grace
