Title: MOVING THE FIREPLACE  
  
engov and resorb and nutrilett bar :: ship a better version of pain island to the espein :: then bella spinning tabata in the sauna followed by brick barefoot :: good thing they have bolt cutters one can borrow :: socks for #2™ and guitar hangers for delftie™ :: different ways to move a fireplace then recover on the sofa :: empty the crystal cupboard and prepare for the last oak sprint by frankie™ :: jacuzzi and a choice between dumb dumber or ig-stream :: settle for the voice of the little garoto and the comments of the little canhota
