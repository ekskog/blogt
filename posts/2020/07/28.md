Title: PALMA NOVA BEACH
  
∆424 then ∆500 :: walking in the rain :: hollow empty thud and lots of blue surgical masks :: bissetriz mediatriz:: musta been the finest of the smooth landings :: a bus too large for the streets of mallis :: tapas at the beach :: because it takes two to paella :: pool no children :: drinks like toothpaste :: schedules and shitty treadmill :: the best tomyum ever :: kids losing their minds
