three very good reasons :: the smith river then the rhine then just numbers and sweat :: it is considered impolite to present your credit card to a cab driver in m√ºnich :: belgian sreet lamps done in lisbon :: mutton okra spinach cheese chick peas and mango lassi :: **sakamoto** :: how to ruin meetings by sending sales guys to technical meetings :: red snapper greens tomatoes sauerkraut ::
