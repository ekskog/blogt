Title: HAPPY HOUR
  
there is not a dull moment in **these foolish things** :: all the small undocumented roadblocks that need to be circumvented before one can debug locally :: and not properly documented is the tweaks on configs and contexts and that hats are not allowed no sir :: properly gone throught the letter cee :: the proper usage of the only analogue information processor in a digital world while trying to keep a high cadence :: a nice-ish diagram with small boxes to finbar™ and guailan™ needs to be properly encrypted :: assaulting the ceramic eggs constantly will have waistline consequences :: a video guided tour of hbvu to lili™ before roku :: manboy film with lots of punches machetes and white trash blondes
