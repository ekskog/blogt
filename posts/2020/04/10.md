Title: THE WAY DELFTIE™ WALKS
  
so no websockets on serverless stupid stoopid :: a shopping spree of things needed like täckbark and kogödsel mandolin batteries and then skip the small chocolate eggs :: bring out the mower and do it two sessions :: in-between these play the vinny reilly part on homecoming and practice mandolin chops for two minutes tops :: nothing clings to life like thorny bushes in pain islan :: so dani is keeping all the barans committed to electric grill only :: consider starting the five one five zero for _victor roger_ but decide on a day off on account of a swollen glass eye :: do the feast in honor of the sunday servant from beirut :: take it to the hot tub instead :: done with **la forêt**
