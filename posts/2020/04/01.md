Title: SOFT GROUNDS FOR INTERVALS  
  
it is pretty psychedelic to sleep in a sulfuric gas chamber :: continue to surf the blogsphere while building images :: a reminding of the real reason why had delft™ left all the way from iz mir :: continue the yocto war and the beet battle :: airfry potatoes and eat salad with old chicken :: soundtracked by breno™ singing :: race a broomstick horse and win :: go kenyan for about one hundred meters :: maybe the problem is the machine type so start an overnight build :: done with **agency** which ends abruptly like the vancouverian™ kinda gave up on the whole shit
