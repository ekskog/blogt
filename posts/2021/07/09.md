Title: THRIFT
  
∆730 ∆804 :: afrobeat : laz y samba : courtesy of looperman :: lə-kŏn′ĭk : lacanianism : the lacanian unconscious is labyrinth:: ten instead of eleven : on account of convent vacations :: totall efficiency : in packing :: then westbound : without stress :: less than one hour : then it is piss pause :: conveniently by the thrift store : no vinyl : but a rather expensive mumin ladder :: a piss by the pond : behind the tesla charging station :: then the larssons spa  and bbq : for bbq and stories :: and quite a lot of spirits : of grape origin
