Title: A SLEDGE  
  
∆825 :: fire day four : cat cow pigeon half fish :: then the one pancake that was left :: isotropic helicoid : epic fail :: paired with a behemouth : than kick's goliath's ass :: book week two : and a free ride for #1™ :: cardinals over priests : and tongues bitten :: the inexact science : of fitting a kitchen :: things one does : to kick start vacations :: spins with families : and leads the pack :: tax free year starts : for the average swedish worker
