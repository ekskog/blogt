Title: PLAYA DE MARTE
  
∆648 :: the worst seleção ever : and travel reports on blekingleden :: to the small lake : pushing hard : then selecting the recording : that gives best results :: smart swimming solutions :: twenty two minutes : gets boiled eggs pretty hard ::  the island called playa de marte : circled in flipp-flopp (disks) : and the tribe of modern sailors :: conscience of self saving : with swastikas : and organs harvested :: as fast as one can : and still misses the opening goal :: three lions : under twenty : non-white : no pineapple on pizza :: the reason miša : costed tens of millions
