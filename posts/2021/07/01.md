Title:   MASTERED
  
∆705 :: the game is today : so peace :: ideas to unmud nikki : including a beatbox :: catch up with estonians : before summer break :: then define a plan : to go sixty four : and commit self to execute :: new year's party : with fanboy™ and ella™ :: segue into elevators : which turned out better : than predicted :: experiments with unmudding : then seeks vdos about mastering : when the real problem is mixing :: back to spinning with nicksis™ : then a good brick :: start katla
