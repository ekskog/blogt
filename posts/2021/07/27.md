Title: MANGO MANNEQUINS
  
∆657 :: quietly follows olympians : procrastinates a run :: then runs : very slow at first :: no bronze : then gold : from a styrofoam lid :: unscrews the shower : in preparation for a vinegar bath : then paint for the balcony : and water :: she urges to free ride : on underground trains :: bodegas : for pulpo and vermouth :: then playa : but first toro y água :: under the shade of the surf rescue : she sleeps :: the fine temperature : of the middle sea :: walk to the crowded : barceloneta :: pretty dudes : scamming italian teens :: then a twenty minutes wait : for açaí and pão de queijo :: walks the gothic streets : for mango and swim gadgets
