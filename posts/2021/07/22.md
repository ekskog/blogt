Title: RESISTING TEMPTATION 
  
âˆ†603 :: ten out : one in :: alektricity : blue :: fiddles with printers : on account of new biz models :: no veggies : so cashews : and corn :: the wood pile : that gives hbvu its favela status : covered in white tarpaulin :: disassembling pallar :: endless commentary : on football tactics :: then swim : in small intervals : of one hundred : times three :: prussian green : perfection
