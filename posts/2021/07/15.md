Title: HALF DISTANCE 
  
∆500 :: goleada : corinthians style :: the one+ is overheating :: erica you bitch : how hard can it be to get it right :: the mantras for the value chain : this is what it is all about :: double click : on the strategy : bingo lingo :: the master of evil intention : our contribution to the species' gene pool :: thankfull for receiving the daily dosage of truth : in this world permeated with murdock's : evil empire of fabricated news :: omelette : with super salad :: more sales shit : preceding devupd for ebikon :: a lot of waves : and against the stream : feels strong : goes the distance :: eats like on death row : fixes hose : and husband :: gríma ása katla done
