Title: SPIDERMEN    
  
∆600 :: no rainchecks : with enough time :: with the barefoot_mountain_king™ : up the stairs : then the hills : that lead to the castle :: a break for matcha : then eight more :: walk to honest greens : the streets full of life : and putos hipsters :: then metro : to more climbing :: where is thirty one :: the terrace : as a way to evade lockdown : the noise carried down : via what is allegedly the coifa :: dinner with cava and dulce de leche : and all the personalities finally assembled
