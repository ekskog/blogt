Title: RENDEZ-VOUS AUGERUM
  
âˆ†711 :: bleams : binged :: blackdot : before data science : and oats :: if one wants to write code : one needs to be a developer :: one telecaster : is all one needs :: two pillows : as a bribe :: cucumber : snickers : red wine : cider : and of course the madrases :: the pre amp : and an orange vinyl :: cube the lamb : put it in the slow cooker :: no picnic dave : and the matrass takes time : to inflate : get another one :: rendez vous at the church :: the giro : clockwise :: ruin a perfectly good pace : on head chilled wind :: the prized is perfectly cooked lamb curry
