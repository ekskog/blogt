Title: PUMPED UP
  
âˆ†525 :: struggles : with routes : curses engineers :: family lines : imagined :: quotas for minorities : imagined :: no matter what : routing won't work :: the total epiphany : of discovering how to set the target architecture :: neil young : pocahontas : an ukelele ::  feedback : you know :: cold bob seger rush : the an impromptu test : with shit results :: followed by lifting weights : lightly no sweat
