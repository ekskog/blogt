Title: WORK RESUMES
  
∆728 :: felt like no sleep : break no fast :: finish joona four :: no joy on port forwarding :: strange albeit valid : architecture decisions in talinn :: left™back in denial : fills thirty minutes :: echo fanboys : for two hours : that amounts to half a million : swedish kronor :: be late for small appliances : pretend to care :: prepare the curries : eat while lead by the swiss_from_lagos™ :: pick parcels : then spin hard : then jacuzzi : to get the head frozen :: anagrams : of famous bandits :: bulgarian diagrams
