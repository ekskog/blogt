Title: STRETCHING SUMMER
  
∆600 ∆700 :: the usual waking up : and being ignored by #1™ :: then works slightly : and gets het to fix brekkie :: no good progress with gardena : and small steps on the clothing chain : in an unknown direction :: then smou to san sebastià : because sun :: then smou to gotica : where roses were disposed : because she needs cosmetics :: the last açaí at elborn : just before autumn closing hours : deserves creme de cacahuetes :: which is not enough to placate : the need for energy :: tries tacos : which was closed :: sits at chakakhan : and invites #1™ :: who chooses aloe ceviče
