Title: DELFT
  
∆601 :: puto renait :: frambozen : blauwe bessen :: tea : which prevented nausea :: ready with two minutes : to spare :: too cold : and windy : sun must come up :: go ruffnecks : together for a third of the way :: then delftie™ : leaves the pack :: the tummy holds : surprisingly well : for maurten and isotonics :: i am doing this : i am doing this :: and it could be done : so it was done :: despite quad camps : from thirty five to forty :: deserves feet heaven : on hoka slippers :: a long shower : then simoni : for swordfish : and lobster soup :: dutch football : has a very large resemblance to pinball :: done with the patriarchs : then forgets how to fall asleep
