Title: THE VILLAGE
  
∆703 :: the dragon : unrising :: groceries : y pán : sin glúten :: a mascarilla : and a hair cut : afghan style :: either a sql error : or bad integration of services : panics :: for no reason as the train was there : on time and with lithuanians : and aqualung :: gets bib : with one minute to spare : in blessed ignorance :: then rendez vous with the others : for pizza :: sponsored by felt : supporting swedish nutrition :: then rests legs :: thinks risotto : would settle for paella : ends up with a señor flores : ljubljana special :: and pannacotta : kiricocho :: neither curtains nor blinds : at colibri : so repurpose a t-shirt
