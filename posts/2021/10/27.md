Title: UP TO TERMINAL 2
  
∆? :: jetlagged : within the same timezone :: the career of the horn player : and other stories to kill time :: destroy the bun : and possibly the toaster :: on a mission : to replace greengrass :: good : young hackers : helping out :: the nice surprise : of things that work first time :: and then _sierra delta_ cards : that are cheap : albeit useless :: can't get the berries : connected to the modbus :: everything else turns fine : apart from the receptionist :  forgetting to book the cab :: the decline of the airline : that can't afford to pay for fast track : or keep a lounge open :: which forces delftie™ : to eat some fantastic carbonara :: then it is fast track to the southernmost : scandinavian country
