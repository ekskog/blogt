Title: THE SECURITY CONTROL
  
∆625 :: what unpaid bike return :: desperately seeking : white mattehorn :: two abandoned attempts : to get homeward bound :: chronos : kaiorós :: the henpecked bureaucrat : at the spotted dog :: the wielder : and the intent :: one hour wait : for bike :: then escapes the extra parking fee : on account of no receipt :: no battery for movies : reads then :: chronos : kairós :: tupi : deutch : espinoza : likes the fruit
