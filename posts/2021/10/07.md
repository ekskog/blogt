Title: LOOKING FOR TAPAS
  
∆620 :: a virtual machine dies : and time is wasted :: the culprit were the logs : eating all disk space :: over priced brekkie : hides in the total bill :: red maserati : black electric passat :: crash course on rfid : and a hat acquired :: a beautiful day : for boquerones : and calamari : a la plancha :: the feedback loop : misunderstood by the venezuelan :: fast track : for lentejas : and almôndegas :: gets told off : by bold driver :: totally dominates : katz cards :: the hugs the porcelain bowl : and returns dinner
