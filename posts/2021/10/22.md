Title: GOING OUT IN A BLAZE OF GLORY
  
∆407 ∆535 :: acorns : arms : lambda acronyms :: while at the porcelain throne :: searches for the token factory : finds open on safari :: fixes stupid bug : struggles : then creates _uniform india_ :: spaniard : brasse : shouting over each other : scaring the life out of the swede :: holds the curry : then gets the cosmos app : validated :: and the really weird : edge hub dead bug :: barbies who snuff : in front of the camera :: permission to tampere : gets more tension : in abusive relationship :: there is little chance : the window will be clean :: lamb korma and mango lassi : instead of burgers :: then the silver screen : for the final bond
