Title: DATA OWNERSHIP
  
∆650 :: nightly tea : for fasting :: catches up on blot : but first : assembles a pi :: as many false starts : as there are screws :: a bunch of meme meetings : those which shoulda been emails :: starts a simulator : while booking rotterdano :: an energy bar : before rans#02™ :: not sure if needed : and the music was extra lame :: then gets more : of her same old shit :: which gives an opportunity : to advance on korean television :: marbles : and the refraction index : of tempered glass.
