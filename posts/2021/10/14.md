Title: LOST KEYS
  
∆438 ∆552 :: both games ended : three to one :: the end of the freekick curse : and another one on the post : for excellent measure :: it takes a few iterations : and mysteriously : twins or methods are not working ::  banned from the pool : for six days :: ill prepared suomilainen : embarrassing puistolainen™ :: segues into more shame : perpetrated by salesmen :: an indian that delivers : and another who doesn't :: partners that bring zero value : and the ostravan who caught them :: tasteless food : to fill for thresholds :: skips weight lifting : and gets told off by coach
