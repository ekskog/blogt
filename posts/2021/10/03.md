Title: RECOVERY DRINK
  
∆512 :: with nausea of course :: shakes sugar : pours in bottles :: overnight oats : forced down :: then coke : and water :: lay down nutrition : but no access to bags : chances the oakleys :: enough pissing : before swim :: which was short : on account of waves :: misses the bike spot : loses seconds :: the bottle cages : fails to hold : on the first road bump :: marta : jocelyn : vadym :: head wind towards mataró : then tail wind coming in : for a peebee :: a sad and slow run : but still no walking :: the spanish way : to organize events :: then train : pretty effortlessly :: rendez vous outside primark : for caddy support :: black rice : sangria : chorizo : at the rambla :: then the best first half : of the season
