Title: LATE NIGHT CURRY
  
âˆ†606 :: the thing with the way humans do dates : makes automating the clothing edge harder :: then again the data : was all wrong anyway :: investigate blob on edge : again :: spinning at the cemetery : three blocks of uphills :: no pants : no clean tee :: berna : on her tights :: without any good explanation : blob on edge works :: prickly pear : fikon cactus :: late night curry : with the larssons
