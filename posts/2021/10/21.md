Title: RETURNING GOODS
  
∆548 :: the team seems to be on a valley : identical penalties : different decisions :: finalizes the exec salving : then expenses :: admits being a shit corporate citizen : for not using the tools of the trade :: changed the card : that keeps the tripa alive :: teaches a seller : to use said tools :: repurposes : kotletter : on the pressure cooker :: as the storm breaks : window washing :: but first : atrocity exhibition :: rainchecks mirolito™ : on account of rain :: then taper run : on the devastation : of paradise :: melene : on white nikes : and nothing else
