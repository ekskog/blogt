Title: RETURNING GOODS
  
âˆ†655 :: they lost : but we only drew : or were robbed :: gets resolved : to learn the metrics shit :: rfid readers : rfid tags : and architectures for tiendas :: funnily enough : the rerouting to kallinge : was a much better deal :: meetings with idiots : behind blue masks :: bring your own cake : to the birthday party :: chicken that tastes like hen : and not enough potatoes :: aluminium sulfate : to stop bleeding :: plundering the family : and blaming bad luck
