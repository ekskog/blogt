Title: HOME MADE IOT
  
∆557 :: a good flat route : on the vättern shoreline :: withings screwing up : an otherwise very good effort :: brekkie : intercalated with parkster :: watches paint dry : until drive :: more parkster : this time outside the supermarket :: provisions : rebuilds : and then no ssh :: so many things could go wrong : and eventually they do :: the other way south : means lorries and more lorries :: then a new airfrier : and things from bezos :: toblerone delivered : but first sauna
