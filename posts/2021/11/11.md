Title: WHILE RUNNING
  
∆620 :: the tap water of la coruña :: k™c5 : money magnet : baby poze :: sunrise : so takes pictures :: está fresquita : lá mañana :: ortofotomapa : batimetria :: someone turned the power on :: econnrefused : and the fun starts :: multiple attempts : to move forward :: all failed : until upstream protocol :: by cab : then by komoot :: with many photo opportunities : and quite fast too :: microwave caneloni : and other processed foods :: rainchecks the squirrel™ : on account of round thirty one
