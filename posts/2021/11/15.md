Title: ELEIKO
  
∆606 ∆731 :: bleams again : this time stealing kids bicycles : or a grey granny one :: rather incredibly : the white _charlie kilo_ : delivers again :: mysteriously : the fake _sierra delta_ : woke up blank :: moves to the other : which is probably fine :: procrastinates with code : until trashed by mother™superior :: gets there with black trek : and it is getting cold :: an absurd back stabbing : followed by team announcement :: which segues : into cosch™ apologetics :: moves hard into getting data into the lake : and mqtt is next :: it is _whiskey sierra_ : not sierra :: apparently stabilized :: right before soup : and digital airlift :: bread and butter : the king of the hill
