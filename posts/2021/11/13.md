Title: WATER TOWER
  
∆6ish :: distributed unconsciousness : emergent :: prepares to return the shuffler : that does not shuffle :: no hip therapy : spinning instead :: gets there late : on account of running : then runs back :: considers moving the ladder inside : discouraged by mand¥™ : which will rather lounge :: brunch at two : leads to eye eating : and subsequently : matkoma :: but first : the worst german grocery store : for tororojo : and magnum on a paper cup :: three hours later : and still bloated :: tries to not sleep : fails miserably :: late night quesadillas
