∆746 :: age wisdom telling one : that there is always another season :: so goes vinyl hunting : and it was good :: demons wizards : violently acoustic nin : and other beloved idiots :: segued into some early xmas shopping : and free gloegg :: rainchecked by bymse™ : but the ladies deliver :: no shower : on account of bump :: gets mistaken : by her son
