Title: EARLY SANTA
  
∆433 ∆643 :: it is tensta time : again :: gets to modbus : for moomin :: but first a new meter : in a warehouse : causing a lot of four oh threes :: intercalated with winter tires : which were pretty heavy : but the good macaco : made things easier :: omelette : old falafels : gnocchi :: meantime : to meaningful : is the steepest of the curves :: snell villa : steckdosendata :: blackdot : after the box : tracks covid level respiration
