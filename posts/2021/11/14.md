Title: PEARSTREET BACKYARD
  
∆637 :: moves comics to ekmini : gets a few more :: k™c7 : waterfall : mountain :: benz: stretched : standing up :: moves the ladder inside : washes window frames : and masks the borders :: it is fathers day : so lasagne : because it is the favorite : of the one that is still here :: curry : and resistance to nap :: until pear street : to watch jerome's partner : fishing in bolivian jungles :: apply first coat of paint : hard chemicals makes it easy :: tries the lasagne : approved by all parties :: the a soccer tradition broken : beautifully at the bambi'se den : with chocolate
