Title: CULTIVATING MICROBES
  
∆520 :: makes preparations for excrement collection : then collects it swiftly :: then some bad swimming : on tired lungs : and no flip turns :: but first : queues to enter the city :: mighty mcmuffin : hashbrowns :: a new computer system : for the lab : but they are trying to expedite it :: the color coding on test tubes : are different in scania :: stiff is the best song ever : of that there is no doubt :: bring the jetsson nano : back to life :: also the no name : waterproof headset :: which happens to not have : shuffling : rendering it useless :: gets into react again : just for kicks :: then tries to evade the queues : and gets murdering thoughts towards bus drivers :: one is less than perf : but ok anyway :: watches vini™ for a bit : and then It is bilbao again
