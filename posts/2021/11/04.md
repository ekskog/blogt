Title: FAST FOOD
  
∆617 :: a bit nauseated : lemon water :: k™c day two : tiger pose :: blackdot : before budgeting :: then orders a small mp3 player : with a shuffle button :: a quick one : on energy for spaniards :: while updating the repo : on connfac :: the subcontinental : having difficulties to follow instructions :: then provision six edges :: the herculean task : of booking la coruña :: of course a child : can't talk to cosmos :: but at least the simulation works :: monaghettis : with nicksis™ : on a decaying bike two :: then burgers : and other assorted groceries :: a carport is your best november buddy
