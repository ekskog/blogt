Title: MEN's DAY
  
∆555 :: travelling west : from a party in south ellowen : on a red bus with an undistinguishable friend : jumping off at muswell hill : and finding it is near cricklewood :: aborted controller : fetches : flattened arrays : as lib :: thousands of chunks : in thirty minutes :: car is idle : so no drizz le jog :: blue spinning : one two three : collecting sweat :: no library on fridays : so curry : ice cream :: tape remove : only indoor washing left :: one line of code : broke the dashboard :: almost the full woop : caged but disco dancing :: forty five minutes : for mand¥™ to come out :: then pizza : with the police :: external input : another input : input button
