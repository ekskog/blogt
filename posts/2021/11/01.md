Title: EXPRESS SHIPPING
  
âˆ†520 :: surprisingly recovered : despite the coughing :: hello kassandra : while the tea brews :: get october done : then fetch the numbers from the stores :: paris booked : now onto the majors : all is left is the ruffneck tee :: to halsohuset for blood test : then to the library for printouts :: and now the clothing data is all in its proper place : by syncing data files instead :: the pains of being a careless idiot : and time lost as consequence :: play the iot doctor : on husband :: hunbatz men : harley swift deer :: heyoehkah : gaixka : gorka : ertzaintza :: but first quesadillas : and guacamole
