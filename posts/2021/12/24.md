Title: NO CARTOONS
  
∆735 :: the dragon slays the velho™ :: unfuckwithable : badass buddha :: dayquill for #1™ : and tea with honey :: far worse mind altering effects :  than strongly type languages :: everyone has a need : to do penance :: last minute groceries : that empty the wallet :: then food preparations : while maintaining tidiness :: no cartoons this year : just humans interacting : over insane amounts of food :: gifts : and vouchers : and block candles :: monopoly as a tool : to erase backa™s marxism
