Title: STAIRCASES
  
âˆ†612 :: twenty two : divided by seven :: janappa redi : and his thirty meg mac :: alexnet : alpha go zero :: for some reason : does tailwind : in parallel : gets bored : with too many divs :: the lack of standards : when it comes to sinks :: fixed with steel wool : and svinto :: finds socks : and solves the screw issue for good :: segues into repurposing curry : with prince sausages :: more mouse traps : while saving the duckpod : on an older itunes :: tone with the crappy coach : and intervals up to seventeen : albeit short : while chicks climb :: looks like viejo : is going to the rich chicken
