Title: BURYING THE LAVENDER PART ONE
  
∆543 :: mitkov™ again : this time as a real estate agent :: back to three sets of twenty : and to $mactreze :: spolarvatska : and service for _xray victor_ :: returns the ladder : and the little shuffler : is lost forever : buried in the snow :: collects spectacles : goves the pandemic excuse : for missing the appointment :: segues into intervals : pushed to half past fifteen :: more debugging : something that can't be reproduced :: then move on to holding registers : and videos that explain little :: a gourmet dinner : out of not much really :: cone of silence : and donkey's farts :: some weird notes : on goytacaz: otherwise it is eleanor rigby really
