Title: TRADITIONS
  
∆616 :: minus sju : fire : with somewhat wet floorboards :: get another account : this time for _victor papa november_ :: initiate the dalestine : into the garments chain :: urka gurka : none banan : for shoulder tapping :: and still : it works on their computer :: a welcome no show : from the galegos :: which means delftie™ can focus : on making other shit work :: like showing nacho : how the _uniform india_ was designed : and consider powerapps :: segues into another start up : those that remove the e before the r :: bring down the plastic evergreen : assemble it : and let #E™ and #M™ dress it
