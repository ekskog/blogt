Title: SEASON STARTS
  
∆542 ∆642 :: packs for winter sports : then eastwards to nyban :: a story from cpc™luke : about astral weeks :: segued by another : of a cousin's friend : knulhut with ammunition :: the lift is closed : but the tracks are on :: a probable broken thumb : is better than a broken neck : ooh la la :: three different routes : and the muscle memory returns :: heracles dragon tower : but first an extra big mac : because alma was distracted :: three minutes through : kamprad warehouse of horrors :: toro : and marabou : at tempo bergkvara :: a rerun of a small dude : playing a very large persona
