Title: BURYING THE LAVENDER PART TWO
  
∆459 ∆547 :: melancholically : petit moritz:: moves into individual : mika loops  
**[ leDuq™ - 07:38 ]** there is a good chance that it was a russian that took the dobro and then left the country passing a gas station for pissepaus and refill.  
messes about with code improvements : then commits to group party :: segues into real hard _romeo papa mike_ : on the reserve bike : trying to at least stay ahead of xx :: brick with the barbies : a shitshow at eighteen pace :: radio frequencies change : that is the reality :: a curatorial music practice : created to foster and celebrate : absorptive listening experiences for the everyday :: puts the code in a container : but first factors out utils :: there is a third chord : in goytacaz: and it is a minor chord :: an invitation for _alpha whiskey_ : turns into currykalas : and dobro investigations
