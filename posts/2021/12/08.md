Title: ARTIFICIAL STONES
  
∆2351 ∆531 :: puffy calypso :: feedback on feedback : and more slavery anchored on stock options :: paholais sisu : the juju king :: too many different ideas : all of them shit :: intercalated with a very uninteresting lab : which is disrespectfully full of mistakes :: nevertheless hurdling : paid off and it worked :: the anglo-saxon origin : of the word wig : which apparently meant grasshopper :: then it is to the city : with a stop at east torp : for one elmtoft :: segues difficult postures : and extreme thirst
