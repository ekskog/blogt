Title: NINJA XMAS
  
∆516 :: charge the sandisk : then fill it :: beer canmera : for twenty two blot :: while acting as a gateway or proxy :: we are beating the pattern : by nine million inched nails :: xmas with the other nerds : would-be members of the hand :: and a german style intro : to the metaverse :: mātauranga māori : tradition : evidence :: one handed cooking : in preparation for the re-kitchening
