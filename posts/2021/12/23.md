Title: LAST MINUTE
  
âˆ†646 :: post install panic : fail to make fire :: gnotobiotic mice : water and sewage :: the hermeneutics of : 'it is very good' :: for startled leverets : and the turtles : at the boundaries of the known universe :: no tone slot :: last minute speed xmas shopping : preceded by bad driving : and a very near collision :: segues into groceries : swiftly done :: a date with india : and brick :: which on vaccines : has its tolls :: the whole family feasts : together for the first time : in a very long time :: then jumps into capitalist games : and gets bankrupted by her
