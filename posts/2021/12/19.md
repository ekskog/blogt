Title: THE MOST EXPENSIVE HOUSE
  
âˆ†558 :: and the fullest moon :: baffled : by mimesis :: raw glass ingots : colored with cobalt :: done blotting : twenty eleven :: while slowly : de-hoarding :: almost three hours : of the long now lectures :: time travel : fucking missile :: then naps : while she paints :: consider running the whole island : but stops at new beograd castle :: gets the whole tour : and a lot of astma : on account of p45
