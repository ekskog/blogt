Title: KITEz 
  
∆714 :: it is actually possible : to run carrying keys and cellphone :: a wee shy of ten : and circling the peninsula :: four eggs : five eggs : difficult question :: bolonia : or zahara : or tarifa ::no matter which : if levante is blowing : it will hurt : and destroy parasols :: kites : like butterflies :: to the city proper : and a beach club :: blue tuna : eggplant : and awful service :: not exactly to the very south : but quite enough on the bridge :: drives to gibraltar : forgets passports : drives back ::  enough time to retrace : the shopping route :: and see the cathedral :: the issue with choosing food : without sauce : and stupid arguments
