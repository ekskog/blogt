Title: THE BRIDGE  
  
∆555 :: too much brekkie : with over salted bacon :: then drives in less than two : and hitches on a camaro :: the office behind the kitchen : is noisy and has no wifi :: revises concepts : that ukrainians : are good in maths :: interesting graph art : but only in china :: leaves to gym early : on account of curry :: no saskia : only frido™ : then abs :: shisha sedarim : ram and dolphin :: to know all chords : and to feel them :: too much cake : is an oxymoron
