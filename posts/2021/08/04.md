Title: BARRIO ALTO  
  
∆727 :: whataboutism :: an extra hour for her :: scrambles eggs : boils eggs :: a panorama pic of san antonio : while she sips coffee :: the place where the caravels set sail : is not really accessible :: following ahata™s advise : the delta of guadalquivir :: turns out to be an agreeable beach : with free parking too :: a river beach : one should not swim at :: chiringuito lunch : then postre para compartir :: a long walk to the palace : under a blistering sun :: the olympics : on rte :: the shopping street in sanlucar : nothing acquired :: the best cocktail bar : at rua da amargura :: eaten by mosquitos : tricked by the waiter : at bar juanito
