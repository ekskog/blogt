Title: NOT BREKKIE  
  
âˆ†555 : but otherwise every hour : at around seventeen minutes :: the absolute power : of the right t-shirt when playing :: walks to z hb : with a break for ovomaltine :: maximum six per room : no masks needed :: elevators : escalators : the space shuttle ::craz yy color code : as a predecessor of qr :: sip video : comm services : the port on buildings : digital all the way to the call center :: abbizz yzy jakko :: tropical ebikon : takes refuge in the mall :: too much ice cream : to compensate for polenta :: then books clarion : on account of no sleep :: steals rituals : in small vials
