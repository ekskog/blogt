Title: RUN ACADEMY
  
∆500 ∆600 ∆700 :: no shit : but a lot of rem sleep :: right into big bad voodoo doll : while she goes to the hairdresser :: which also happened in taiwan :: use epochs : to cheat date calculating :: how long does it really take : to provision an apigw :: a better strategy : for xtr bandcamp is needed :: to run academy : but first : fetch elmtoft™ :: chooses the easy gang : on account of being laz y :: get instructions by putte™fnask : and follow them :: pushes further : than agreed with delftie™ :: the demiurgic powers of the loom :: not the fruit
