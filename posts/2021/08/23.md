Title: THE BACK ROAD
  
âˆ†736 :: oats : mango : for two :: freezes scene interlude : reduces the grand piano impact :: god prepares : to leave africa behind :: people that excel in their profession : should be acknowledged :: surprisingly enough : the legs are in good shape :: back to back meetings : with russian peoples :: then a lot of bitching : on the peer's group :: barcelona on points : is more expensive than transatlantic : so norwegian it is :: which charges more for a bike : than for a person :: the parking lot : totally full :: the trick to be pack leader : is to wear a heart rate monitor :: to read a shopping list from a smartphone when wearing contacts : one can always take a screenshot
