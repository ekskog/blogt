Title: GETTING THERE PART TWO 
  
âˆ†808 :: the rooster also run over : which is interesting :: recipes for flapjacks : and protein bars :: sephardic : haredi : mutzafi :: the bandcamp algo : is slightly humiliating : if not miscalculated :: for some strange reason : it will give four hundred : when containerized :: and then of course : there is the old issue of _roger tango foxtrot mike_ :: the inauguration of the new roller blades : on shite asphalt :: before inverted thresholds : to absolutely shite music :: and debates on the need : of floaters for swimrun :: rounded of with : yog a with weights :: and there is groceries to be acquired : in case of curry
