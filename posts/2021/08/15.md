Title: ANTIGENS FOR #1™  
  
∆551 :: bleams of long queues : and big waves :: highly cultivated moral aptitude :: panfakes : a bit too fluffy :: mows the lawn : drives #1™ to antigen :: filthy : tamai :: der bomber : alongside nanci :: the end of the agricultural experiment at hbvu : the pallkragar were lifted : and the dead plants trashed :: after much deliberation : and weather blaming : out with felt : for a giro :: it felt pretty good : until the biskopsberg wind wall : which took the pace to humiliation level :: there is however : an opportunity to skip bodypump : and jumps in the jacuzzi
