Title: MERCADO DE PULGAS  
  
∆716 :: yo soy un frijolero : y los otros tres son giris :: the atm transaction : won't complete :: which is a good way : to not spend money : on old stuff :: the dassanes flea market : then the supermarket : which was closed :: the cornershop had ground beef : so köttbullar it is :: on an orange donkey : straight into frijoles beach :: swimming under yellow flag : and the normal pace : which does not seem to change :: brasilian beach manners : and bikinis as worn by fat ladies :: la carioca then : for all things yucca : and a tapioca :: a real trashing : perhaps in good timing : so we can be alert
