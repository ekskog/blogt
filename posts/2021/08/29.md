Title: MORE EVERGREEN
  
∆812 :: and still it felt : like unrest :: no panfakes today : breakfast burritos instead :: decide on unchore : as promised her :: the agriculture project : no longer visible :: possibly the last mowing : for this season :: while the pool fills up : slowly with eleven celsius water :: starts fixing neumann flaws : on dictators :: and while at it :  remasters a la underbelly :: totally in need for napping : but first deliver #2™ to bergåsa :: prepares food : for later on account of being tardy :: runs with old shoes : and a tracked with reserve batteries :: then sweats more profoundly : on account of a super crowded aerobics room
