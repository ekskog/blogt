Title: THE CIRCLE  
  
∆500 :: one bleam per hour : all forgotten :: not much pod left : so radio :: the demographics of public radio three : are they all preteen girls :: compression techniques : for morning show : maggio swift :: lounge brekkie : because it is free :: upgraded : but why doesn't happiness : equals three slices of salami :: the corporation is now : adjacent to the airport :: urinary advice : for nokagou™ approaching forty :: another junior suite : at fifteen degrees :: consider limmat : get convinced on uetliberg :: but first kiosk : for tororojo : and cliff bars :: uber with nwankwo : who gives no shit to private roads :: clinb four hundred meters : power walking : and running when flat :: the trail : destroyed by storms :: fresh enough : to run back to the hotel :: skip dinner : on account of uber eats rates
