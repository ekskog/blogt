Title: A RAINBOW
  
âˆ†500 :: speaking up : because promotion :: watts gone : only the glimmer twins left :: paid in full : and left alone by the taxman :: hirsutism : on attic : and elite :: moo shu : added plums :: orders whoop for her : then add a few extras :: resolve electioneering block : on _charlie papa foxtrot_ :: an invite to invest : in real estate in rural brasil :: gets a place for the cage : despite the heavy rain :: fourteen people : raises the temperature of the spinning room by three degrees :: twenty six letters : not enough exercises
