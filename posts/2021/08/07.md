Title: AFRICAN CAMPING  
  
âˆ†708 :: no charge : postponed run :: on airplane mode : plus bluetooth : route adjusted once : with thirteen strava medals :: on ground : on water : we are golden :: this time turkey : while salad lasts :: then underdogs : against the spaniards : who are no good on one-on-one : so gold :: everywhere is a crowd : so parts of the beach are closed :: find a spot : beside the north african muslim matriarchy : gucci mamma : : and just opposite : to hundreds of pounds of flesh :: no can shop : without mascaretas :: shopping before tacos : walking poles for high coast
