Title: CHUCHES HUGO  
  
∆647 :: meets the finest gato preto : down the stairs from barrio alto :: right at the river : towards doñana :: runs in sand : misses the baluarte :: the ruins of the place : from where magellan set sail :: no issues with cincocento : parked as it was :: water from the ice cream parlor :: seis com cinquenta : at the bodega for desayuno :: less levante : but reading is still impossible :: sardines on carbón : at the top chiringuito :: the impossible task : of using googlemaps : she said :: no returns after hours : the road back from fuel :: a sightseeing opportunity : provided by the bus driver :: almost a ghost city : on account of the heat :: all bodegas are closed : fries for mashed
