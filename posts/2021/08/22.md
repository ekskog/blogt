Title: SELLING FISH
  
âˆ†705 :: tunings galore : with squirrel :: pancakes : in two batches :: all socks : on the floor :: then sugary water : in two camel paks :: coaches : paces : mission accomplished : with slightly sore legs :: repurposing sauce : with teriyaki :: anatomy of absence : or the embarrassing events : at the pigsty :: gets the thing on the window : that she has asked about a year ago :: the wrench to fix the parasol : is nowhere to be found :: not exactly an embarrassment : but nevertheless felt like giving up
