Title: EL BORNE DOORS  
  
∆445 :: the synchro of red lights : in the seville night :: how not to dimension : security control :: blowing a bugle : loudly from the sidelines :: ekpryotically cyclical :: out on the square : not the uni :: very tired indeed : so get extra zzz:: not really beach weather : so walk to el born instead :: dreams of churros : settles for açaí :: a piece of galicia in raval : which served good food : for the not very hungry :: a coben book : in barcelona : or was it elsewhere
