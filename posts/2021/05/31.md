Title: EIGHT STATIONS
  
∆603 :: etienne™ will you please : fix the appuri shit :: chances are slim : so fixes oneself :: a little smoothy : before the roof :: eight stations : with the ladies : for the birthday of the madre™superiora :: more deadbanding : out to version sixty or whatever : with kurt™ the sioux :: fatherhood follows : into assisted breathing : and an agreement to maintain dignity :: most ever distance covered : must be the new playlist :: tell her : of the sadness in delftie™s eyes : and the absence of appetite :: a zoom call : with a proper doctor : to understand the possible end : and what causes it : the inevitability that is an outcome : of days pilling up
