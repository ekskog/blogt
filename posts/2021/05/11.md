Title: TOMBSTONES FOR KINGS
  
∆709 :: waiting for dirty editors to save : your changes will be lost :: sometimes it is the right : sometimes it is the left : it only hurts when pressed hard :: gives honest feedback : instead of delivering blame :: quinoa : blomkålsris : omelette :: northbound for water : and meets the german construction worker :: wonders on the effects of breathing : on freestyle swimming:: like not  the only way : way better : better to be able to able to get : hunnhh will : hwill vui jokk :: destroy calf : on mud : take snapshots : of dead trees
