Title: INISDE THE EGG  
  
∆653 :: a month : without sweetening :: buckwheat : no honey :: puts the советские девушки : on the drive : apart from kate :: upon the roof : for hips in the cold wind ::  groceries : restrained : and invading spaces :: heats up : mand¥™s spa ::  heats lasagna : and it was not that bad : with tabouleh :: the spa guest : overstays his welcome : and eat three bananas :: goes for fifteen : on carbon plates : which really improved : an awfully tired run :: the last shack on ring island : bulldozed to bubbetorp :: hattifnattar : from a kinder egg : then car washed :: since the pool is hot : segues into it : with cider :: preps the grill : grills with panache :: ghosts : both good and bad
