Title: SOVIET OPTICIANS
  
âˆ†636 :: hugo : azure static : giraffe :: totally masters : elena : **so much trouble in the world** :: the veterans : assembled the bike shed : and it fits beautifully :: no focus : procrastinates about :: probably lies about sparkplug : and about greek managers : and about testing devices :: very comfy on carbon x : and still not under five :: pushes with the elite : no water or towel :: jogs back : in hunger : while she grills
