Title: LES ESTONIAN RUMBA ENSEMBLE
  
∆500 ∆600 :: hepta : and a scoreless draw : on adjacent rooms :: the cello must be : the musical avatar for melancholia :: no spinning : on account of finland’s timezone :: it is rather easy : to spend someone else’s money :: play further : with deadband :: sc can za :: to the pepparstraße sauna : for rumba : on a sixty nine telecaster :: then cucumber : and grapefruit : on ice : with mom :: top it up with cider : for extra tipsiness : while eating grilled food
