Title: POOLSKÖTARE
  
∆622 :: stretch : et cetera :: a quick three minutes : on all hands :: while procrastinating : on hugo :: different ways : to keep the finns confused :: then panics : over edge :: crafts slides : and makes two hours fly :: but first : schedule vaccine :: while she cleans the pool : screws tight the parasol foot :: swaps saddles on qroos : and finds the consequences of hard breaking :: acquires cheap tire : and park bravely outside :: not much of a brick : more like a painful walk :: brax moy
