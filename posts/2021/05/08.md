Title: SPIRALS
  
∆515 ∆725 :: handles dhcp : then reboots router :: moves pifour to #2™s : to make room for jetson :: enough layers : for whatever weather : may hit the roof :: jogs : crosses paths with the fast youngsters : accelerates :: fish tacos : with herring :: unsuccessful napping : leads into pesach : from the mannequin factory :: neumann : a far superior singer : even without falsetos :: all ips : allocated :: goes up to the attic : fixes cables : removes hoarding : well some of it :: feeling like flinta : or carré : and fill a bag with other stuff :: grills : enough for a third person : which is a developer : from moldova :: then its gramps : against nicknames
