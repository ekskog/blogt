Title: LOOKING FOR THINNER
  
âˆ†330 :: start blotting : from day one :: the plumbing still : kinda rotten :: getting twenty ten in order : with photos and tags :: one hundred percent : a total of twenty one families supported :: anger : is sometimes constructive :: channel it : towards storing summer :: then one hour : of wind : and confusion :: segues a lot of zzz: and a failed attempt : to use red spirits as glue remover :: bandcamp is no longer : a place for the small people :: gets white spirit : and olfa blades : and wages war on masking tape :: pauses changing the game : for salmon and chorizo :: **the frame** : on the silver screen
