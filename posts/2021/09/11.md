Title: SPIDERS 
  
∆559 :: a sewage system : for breathing :: starts organizing america : which leads to the destruction of guatemala :: blackdot :: oats : on account of time :: release four : the knee killer :: but first groceries : and monster :: defrosts the dough : stretches the dough :: courtains should be hung : in delftie™s opinion they should not :: jacuzzi : at forty ::   purple aperol : white cava :: add a different chord sequence : wirelessly :: intuitionist mathematics : and the block universe :: a brilliant sci-fi : or a tragedy of epic proportions
