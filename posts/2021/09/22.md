Title: TO THE FRONT ENTRANCE
  
∆402 ∆550 :: overnight oats : then pool : in chunks of six hundred :: dives deep into discovery : shaking the german tree :: baby steps : to tell the owner : the nature of what she owns :: gets a place : on both classes :: takes the public transport : on account of not bothering with roller blading :: mosquito fodder again : and some dancing too : after burpees :: gets mistaken by gym personnel : on account of black attire
