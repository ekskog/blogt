Title: CROSSING COUNTIES 
  
∆608 :: enough time to get ready for riding : but the fog the rain :: climbs the duck ladder : to wash and mask :: brings down the old imac peripherals :: adds a scene or two : to the navajo song:: the sun kind of outs : and he decision is made :: spends thirty minutes prepping : on account of unstable atmospheric conditions :: slow start : on account of sore legs : and knees :: picks it up eventually : and it all goes to shit after torsås :: portpones jacuzzi : and miraculously manages to eat :: washes the felt : changes the battery on the p1 :: not enough whoops : on bodypump :: then curry : and parfait :: the situation on the pigsty : continuous to favor the vultures
