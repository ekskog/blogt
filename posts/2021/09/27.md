Title: KAJSA'S MYS
  
∆528 :: too tight : withings band :: then a quick protein shake : to the pool : for one lap of fifteen :: the garmin didn't register : therefore it did not happen :: since no intermittance will be achieved : buckwheat :: gets itu with the quest : for vessel simulator for andrei™ :: but first william with an em : gets all wet of his shit : which is good shit :: the issue with hiring incompetence : and supermodel names :: a potential wall is hit : on account of shit design :: everything that could go wrong : and then more :: perseveres : wins :: a proper spinning gig : called cosy monday
