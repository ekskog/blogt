Title: A TRAFFIC JAM 
  
âˆ†536 :: re-enters the bad : quietly and fulfilling : in one hundred intervals :: the problem is definitely : in the total volume of air in the lungs :: edits slides online : feels silly and unfulfilled :: then of curse : remember not to schedule demos for monday mornings :: extremely hungry : devours crisps : and monster :: dead dragonflies : in austria : is that also chaos theory :: baudrillard theme parks : rightfully incorporated :: no nurse : but a fit granny in her stead :: perceptual androids : and other fictitious bands
