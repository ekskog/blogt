Title: DOCKYARDS  
  
∆536 ∆636 :: egg sandwiches : and strangely fresh legs :: then packs : and drives back : for a swift return of the seat :: twenty minutes : for a burger :: two hours sleep : courtesy of a buff :: pings : glitches : life forms :: some laptops : weight less than a kg :: the twin towers of the cable factory : make pain island recognizable : from an airplane :: then forgets the ekmini : on the seat pocket of eight c :: a small detour : to get groceries :: then one paracetamol : and one ibuprofen :: the issue with argentineans : and immigration laws
