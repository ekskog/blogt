Title: FOURTEEN
  
âˆ†530 :: the old trick : of tiny paper on the saddle :: chop chop : for fruit salad :: putting each other on the spotlight : then winning by a million miles :: delete the gw : recreate another :: while the curries cook : because she likes them :: then to suomi : with a couple of teemus : but first scavenging slides :: lies one tells : to keep meetings short :: sofa and then : another failure on apim :: off to spin : with an aching right knee :: then fixes chrome books : gifts iPad keyboards : and gets marabou :: to the city : for fourteen : in a dark corner :: sauces with too much salt : needs better ice cream
