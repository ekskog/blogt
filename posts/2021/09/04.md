Title: THE HIGH COAST  
  
∆522 :: extra brekkie : no lactose :: then bus : and the adventure starts :: almost gets lost : then learns how to follow the blue dots :: not exactly gentle : on ankles :: cab : ron : diem :: through the gorge : of deadly stones :: downhill towards the island : which was way harder :: cabra mecânica : coyote de cuernavaca :: two km : of very bad karma :: then teaches : chi breathing : and chants military songs :: climbing down : is way harder :: until the final sprint : after the ski slope upwards : and getting cheated by chivas™ :: coke : goulash : but no dry clothes :: goes down on the sit lift : alone and shouting :: eats a burger : while the girls fetch the seat :: then find energy : to shake to chuck berry :: get on the jacuzzi : and the sauna : for the champagne celebration
