Title: GLASSHOUSE 
  
∆728 :: a bleam of natalie merchant : busking outside åhlens : hooked on a feeling :: and another : of forgetting passports :: sunburnt : but stretched :: batteries for bike lights : and rosé wine :: the hammock : with a pillow :: #2 delivers : fun house : metrobolism : islands :: hemiz was partly right : not a trumpet : but a cornet :: add holes to the hose : then saw the bad bits :: bring down the autoharp : untuned but passable :: record some : on the ukelele :: the swimming still sucks : to a worrysome point :: then a raincheck : from blueberry way :: kinda revoked : for footie on the telly : inside the oap glasshouse
