Title: ELECTRIC LIGHT  
  
∆555 :: rowhammer : half doubles :: musse gets his drops : and soft food :: mayan america : as fully repurposing bleams :: then goes looking for churches : and gps coordinates :: the plastic roof : on the bus stop : proved to be an easier task :: sandwiches : grilled or toasted :: different ways : to say goodbye : on push to talk :: twenty becomes : the spinning normal :: bricks : while nicksis™ goes under four :: greek chinese : crossed over : for deck dinner :: get nominated : by sheer force of brotherhood
