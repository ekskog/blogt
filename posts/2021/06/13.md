Title: NEW ROADS
  
âˆ†624 :: no wind : but no cycle :: learn more : and still fail : on small things :: out for ten : on a new path : and the camera fails :: brings out the hammock : falls asleep with eldritch :: demesne : homeopapes : frgawdsake :: nicely sands the lists : then oils them :: the elders : properly entertained : with ice cream and jazz:: then the sea : for some poor static swimming :: blame it on over-reaching :: take six out : and we still massacred : the poor rabbits
