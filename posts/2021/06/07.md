Title: CAGED  
  
∆600 :: give up event gridding : just use plain axios :: finns with a strong language barrier :: conversations with long forgotten friends :: they should be a better tool : for changing bike tires :: at the roof : in a cage : owning the abs :: zzz: then tororojo :: the word box : and its negative connotation :: the word pivot : and its high status in redmond :: corporate politics : and the art of pissing almost everyone off :: the cube : ready for the road :: then ride : to the ride : then ride back :: grill : ventilate with x™giver : then cumadi™ : on a bed of nails
