Title: WASHED AND DRIED
  
∆725 :: no buckwheat : granola :: macca ambigramed : not sator squared :: what is the dev cert used for :: meet on zoom : as teams not sharing :: liquified : petroleum : gas :: slight changes : in niki voice melody :: roja™ : hungarian :: meetathon : segues back to certs :: then elevators : escalators : german triathletes :: then three lions : on a shirt :: washes the felt : and the vehicle : and delftie™ on jacuzzi :: the bitter taste : of undeserved defeat : on the last move :: done with rocky and grace
