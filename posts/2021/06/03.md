Title: SALAD  
  
∆500 ∆640 :: out to place the plastic roof : on the bus stop : with her and the wind :: two and a half hours : occasionally listening to sellers :: a hunt for the proper way : to toggle dark mode : and the difficulty in deciding a layout :: volunteers time : for green energy : while sellers continue to embarrass :: very fast screwing the last bits : that are  probably of no use :: then totally owns the trains : out of the crap consultants :: gets an extra thirty minutes : and the bus stop is ready :: _juliett india tango_ for sandwiches : and smoothies :: :: considers rollerblading : hitches with her :: spins : lifts weights with the asians : jogs back
