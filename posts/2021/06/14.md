Title: DEFENSE 
  
∆705 :: adam walks : the oceans : rotates the hips :: a contradiction : in narratives : marseille style :: panic over deadlines : and accepting things without consideration :: laces under tights : seagull shit : burpees inverse pyramid :: then moussaka : seasoned with tacoskrydda :: definitely abandons frameworks : for now at least :: lies about salaries : as a way to push the recruiter away :: priceruns the scan hybrid : gets it on open box : for extra money of course :: she gets the job : well deservedly :: by car to spin™doc : on account of meetings :: possibly the most cowardly performance : on an international stage
