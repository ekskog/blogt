Title: AEROBICS HALL
  
∆511 : incredibly : again :: with the weirdest chain : of hyper-real mothé bleams :: re-provision elite : as a gateway : problem solved :: when a deck is needed : scavenge onedrive :: well delivered : despite wrench : and the dismal attendance :: quinoa : raw rice : pulled beef :: loosh at soundcloud :: bonsaied : or brains growing on trees  :: plastic bags : as socks : under the other socks :: then thresholds : with the core team :: followed by apples : snatches : squats :: minimum weight : maximum reps
