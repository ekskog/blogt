Title: SNOW APOCALYPSE
  
∆540 :: about forty cm snow : it buried the lavender :: so plow : around xv : and to the wood :: hemi™ sold his butter : then lost the money :: connect : no good for nothing :: then a very strong progress : on the mp3 backup issue :: allyship : adversary-ship : bullship :: a good progress : on a web home for eliot :: at thirteen hundred : the snow storm cleared :: a difference in alphabets maybe : because w has vanished : from the music archives :: more shoveling : this time with a machine :: tuilagio : startxfce4 : voilà :: spinning : with her : on my nikes :: more japflax : and stuff for the trip :: end of dirk's s01 : sean pean the astronaut
