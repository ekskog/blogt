Title: ONE DIGIT TOO MANY
  
∆231 ∆631 :: iron ox :: wait for her : surfing on the china throne :: whitedot : then a solid brekkie :: to the car : jit to avoid the lapplisa :: minus eighteen : slightly better at the mountain :: all pists open : with powder : and siberian winds :: but not on the other side : which was glorious :: goulash : chocolates : in various states :: two hours more : then she froze :: addict to gps : and bad signs : a detour through sandvik :: trauma caused : by how much real furniture costs :: twenty percent : miscalculated
