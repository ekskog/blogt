Title: BACK SPINNING
  
∆619 :: minus elva : that's a new low :: stretch thy hip kat : then make banana muffins :: damian the unicorn : cytokine storm :: discover greg norton's band : searching for supernova : and he still has it :: forensics on lucia : twenty thirteen :  ĭ-fĕk′choo͞-āt″ :: thirty minutes : on the ice track :: omelet : shared :: the self standing : brazilian factory workers :: leaves time enough : to register for fundamentals : and to complete twins learning :: fantastic tareq's falafels : and tabouleh with quinoa :: then spin : carefully : and still rule :: alita : not angel
