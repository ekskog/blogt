Title: MOST CALORIES BURNED
  
∆521 :: stressed over the fact : that this is not a leap year : and still procrastinate :: make pie : and facetime #1™ : while she trains outdoors :: remain : in : light :: bring out the qroo : store the snow blower :: shower the _x-ray victor_ : and do it well :: the effect of squats : on cycling :: an okay effort : despite sand on the curves : and a bad driver : both on augerum-losen :: what is grief : if not love persevering :: comics with awesome art : and some with crap art
