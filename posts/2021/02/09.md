Title: ANTI SOCIAL
  
∆555 :: fast : with mint and ginger :: onetera sometimes : just won't mount :: koreans interested in weather : but otherwise not really progressive :: snow storm : intervals :: then join the phone company : on a conference : without telephones :: the reputation : of the salesmen :: agree on an agenda : to start with :: progress on the larger disk : until it’s empty :: then format it :: chicken tikka : that looks like  korma :: skip stations : which has replaced basisboll
