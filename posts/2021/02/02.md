Title: HISTORIANS
  
∆558 :: chinelada no ixpó :: one tera : overheating : then halting :: the patience needed : when communicating remotely with asians :: treadmill : then insults :: a good one for ebba sebbe : and a few others :: then at fifteen : smoothie : and sofa :: interrupted : by bad architectures :: the cranium seems to squeeze the brain : at least the north side :: more gourmet : and artichokes :: iron : then find two loosh rarities :: sofa again : for a marvel sitcom
