Title: NO ONE'S WAITING
  
∆627 :: minus quinze° : is it even possible :: beans : quinoa :: a day without meetings : leads the soul astray :: all music organized : uploaded : backed up :: the surface pro is slick : but full of bugs :: but then one sets the clock : and all starts working magically :: a still stuck : on cascadings :: ice bugs : craft tights : jog : break the headlamp :: spin with the nucleo-duro : sweat like there's no tomorrow :: then jog back : in the dark
