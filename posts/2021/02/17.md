Title: TOO MANY WATTS
  
âˆ†511 :: ash wednesday :: the snow didn't come at four : but it came for sure :: scavenge for decks : successfully : quickly :: too much snow : covering the trax : of the red village :: fix the cascades : with borders : but still no navbar :: the chicken mince is out : so make patties : before the salmonela takes over ::  succubi : incubi :: still an troupe of six : spinning to blue monday : then brick :: while being chicked : by a slim teen :: take it to luxemburg : while the astronauts are on recess
