Title: DEMOLITION MAN
  
the notion : jurassically hued :: a day to recover : the travel machine :: looking at the clock : at the exact time :: a new passport : and an okey swim :: if you don't have a tv license: it won't take us long to find you :: move things around blot : imagine a workflow :: slumber on the sofa : then reconnect with vector ::: the young uns recover : with a little help : from a dismal opposition :: swap phones with #2â„¢ :: book ended : and still no wiser : on time
