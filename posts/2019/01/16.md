Title: PASTE BLAME
  
∆135 then ∆320 : learn how to do rest : properly : a feeling of changing tires : on a moving car :: evacuate centre-ville : yelling induced : @self would have maf'ed faster :: finish before lunch : twin tagging :: meet @messerschmidt : and discuss x-country skiing :: wait and polish : polish and wait : the blame game :: drive back in twenty : on seven twenty east :: calves of an old man : a crappy stationary :: canada and the lima group
