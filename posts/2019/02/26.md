Title: BANKRUPT  
  
life was what you made it : mister hollis âˆ·  foppery and frippery : to brittle :: a bowl of chia pudding : after lemon water :: fix the twin : and find another issue : while selecting anything but star :: close the lid : and bike to pool : to do the half hearted kenyan thing : after an altercation with the lifeguard  :: then fix the six ess : and crop the sides to two : and the top to four :: one of the books : and science :: kill time : no power corruption and lies left :: spend time with austrians : then conspire with milou :: fix dinner : and run the south hill : six times :: the ballisic theory of light : alice and bob :: from meaningless tragedy : to happy ending : in no time :: andyanderson
