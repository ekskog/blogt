Title: THE SWISS COMMUTE
  
the cutting edge of the now. cuts cues. will the prototype slacker at the fringes of narrative. beating trash with a sledgehammer. anti aura. a gold wave forever. salad at the pizzeria. with the intent to heckle. with minikubes on the kustpilen. the cluster of cells attached to an old style bluetooth headset. called george. chocolounge goddamnit. gare one to lausanne. maladiére, electrically. mirabou, gymless. manolas.
