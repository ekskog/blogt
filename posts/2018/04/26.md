Title: WHERE THE GROCERIES ARE
  
the palpitations before acknowledging the incompetence of the banana bunch. panic over infrastructure. dive heads first and procrastinate. a rental car and filling up the cupboard. a jambalaya turned into risotto. washed down with matchai. herpes on the back of the proveyor of Y. eighty four for the proveyor of X. work for bonuses. retire altra. rewire altra.  'alas, poor yorick! i knew him, horatio’ felatious monk. the continuous fluidity of flux. in russian kidnapping a french spy. or fries. fried in the republic of the banana. falling apart. slowly.
