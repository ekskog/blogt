Title: CLOSED  
  
∆619 ∆631 all the files in cloud drives. it is all white in all directions. winwood. upload to blob. season’s end at the slope. uneventfully. squirrel slow death by labor. would you call it a freak? pizza for three. bin liners for clothes. or vacuum. a nap. then resorb at the hot tub. still no coach. yet another banana flavoured clusterfuck.
