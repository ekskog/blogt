Title: BOND'S WHEELS  
  
bird chirping by all means. but not at four am. toi toi toi straks. weil heiss. like sugar sardines on u1\. sun strokes delivered free. pink isn’t well he should have stayed at the airbnb. or exited on half. the jay zâzcrew took to the streets. the paranoia at thirty nine. pee double you. a tummy churned on glycogens. saved by mixed grill. coding under the influence. risotto with egg plants.
