Title: HEAT
  
does the moon turn obama? 2uXuHOY gonzalezfrom the island. the föhn wind. all rovelli’s science novels. galileo’s slingshot life on earth. which is blue. almost falling from a tree is scary shit. mand¥™ does it better. like moonraker. the log stapling favela facelift project. bark turns into earth. the wrong type of chemicals, screwdrivers that are an inch too short. saved by bolas™. a debate wether leasing is more economically advantageous than a loan. with migoel™. a fast loop almost all on race stance. tacos pizza.
