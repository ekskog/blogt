Title: PANICKING GLITERATTI
  
abs crunched. the case of the vanished wifi voucher. no cure for french brekkie. only perhaps disintegration. airport, train, hotel, taxi. could be anywhere but they speak french. fight the ethiopian taxi driver. the packaging factory. ass kicked. potatoes and courgettes. snapd. c. immigration and integration politics in french swiss. absent thai leads to a fantastic salad. craving for electricity. lose a thought train and come up with eighteen dollars. the mother of all taxi queues.Â
