Title: RIVER PEOPLE
  
taxi at the curb > taxi by concierge > uber. late but still on time. a tough but kind opposition. learning by improvisation. worked this time. the edges of parc cervantes. all the folks on kick bikes. better than powered - no kicking necessary. cheap chinese garments. no wallet. cream ibiza. measure oneself up against a chubbilicious crossfitter. iskariot the finn rabbies breeder. tapioca or mandioca. not the same dumbfuck. the evils of social media and a quasi-luddite #1â„¢.
