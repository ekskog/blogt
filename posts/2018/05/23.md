Title: GASOLINE
  
wheat flour for oats. not a good idea. mail procurement. get the bureaucracy wheel spinning. reblink the imp. swim intervals quite okey-ish. reinvent lillypop vehicle. bloody deniers/approvers. all the colours of spring. such a classic. sampled. the sales guy promised it would work. denier overpowered. by flunk. beljians gedis and spaniards from the communité helvetique. overpriced grosseries. more on the grill. challenge il_professore™.
