Title: HOLES IN THE PAVEMENT
  
where the republic is >> hallucinations of firewalls. or blue unicorns. photos of exotic fishing birds. the cavities of the world. candy crush saga for bored couples. itaquaquecetuba as a word predicted. binge a little. panic a little. a feeling unexpected. of being foreign. kilo food in a restaurant where every waiter loves jay-zuz. labs need to be booked five days in advance. deck crafting. a half arsed stationary bike ride. lame food courts and lamer soccer game. win over jetlag.
