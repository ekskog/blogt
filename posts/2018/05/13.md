Title: BAUDELAIRES
  
∆517 grrrr all rabbits are frightening. between volumes and forever. caxinguelê lame bikers. then containers. lassi for brekkie. setlist cheaters. when in hassle seas, finja. the prejudice of the blind. in a refrigerated bus. lots of claims. aeroplane foods twice. stanislavski methodism. plakatieren verboten. all museums close at night. except for halle e. where barney baudelaire and the synth orchestra minus guitar nero performed an off choice of numbers.
