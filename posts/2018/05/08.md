Title: ALL LOST
  
too little sleep. shared cab rides. pentheraphobia. sesquipedalianism. hedonically treadmilling. suffering from myopic discount. learn how to circumvent it. go public transportation all the way. supermarket visits before the supermarket. problems with wifi. measuring the air quality for human generated gases. like methane. pad thai under the sun. in sun-dbyberg. wrap up tethering. akallean pitstop. run decently to the castle. this time without snow. brie for halloumi. change strategy. regret not using version control. freak out about burning out.
