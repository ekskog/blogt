Title: BARTô
  
the fourth of the seven sons of antonio. a diary from eighty eight. distribution of phones. stocking extra forte coffee for mand¥™. jabácumgirimum. the shadows of the marina hotel on leblon sands. a possible definition for happiness. strolling with papaya™. arrange a bike for a hard climb then raincheck. beegee and its selection of sushi. malabarists and trombonists. a key is a good thing to have. when the people inside are nearly deaf and asleep.
