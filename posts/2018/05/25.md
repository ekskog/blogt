Title: HELLERUP
  
robots awakening at 2am. the beginning of the apocalypse. or a singularity. all the emails with updated privacy policies. flame love bazzar. or maybe tahiti diamond hexagon. as lovesongs of course. educate micklind™ into dockerzand portz. run the hard knös island route in zero for five intervals. surprisingly well. which makes one deserve a slap on the ceiling. two millimeters maximum. an array of inefficiently stores data. logarithmic units of air displacement. do the dot to lyngby for blue tacos and red wine. the bagosverdes street fest. where the elderly dance to dirty blues. round up without claritin. red wine. unthorn the red roses. wrapped in cling film.
