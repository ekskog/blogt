consider re-enacting the river. scan xmas ninety nine. plan for twenty go one and half shorter. nrg levels less than abysmal. soak then get a throne cushion and mop board to hang the shelves. upside-down. capitalization is murder. assist the lawnmower lad. everyday is like armaggedon cometh. walkmen as hearing aid for the massacred. tenzin gyatso. mad deeds in the realm of the natural selected neural computer.
