Title: WEDDINGS
  
keep the good snapshots. then iron a little for show. dream on new order in vienna. timezones in telemetry. totally misjudge the quality of the swimming. there is a quicker path to vienna. and it means something to everyone. refit the cadence meter. bring out the hammock. pulverizing of worm roses leaves. the containment of remaining feelings. from the redskin days. swinging in a hammock. brasilian style. a melody ocean. or at least that's how it sounds. light the grill. find a logic flaw. fix a logic flow. that which is not noise.
