laugh at the cod fish. get a deck done. ancyatomer. risotto. a fake tag, courtesy of a razzia on the cameronese by the guardia. deceive exhotbox™ for bizarro spotting at the beach promenade. the naked elderly hippie gets the whistles of the bikini folks. super tired mandy™. bounce at hotels then an amazing run/climb with #1™. a real mastercard moment. replenishment on the wrong type of raw fish. taxi drivers that text. while driving.
