Title: MOSQUITOES
  
glue and snap : a bleam with flanders™ : or wallim™ :: loon : loonies :: ninety nine luftbaloons : and one baboon :: an idiot named astro on rollerblades : posing : small tall not the proper size :: solve it by swimming : slow : for no reason :: crack the mux : it is always the lib :: cherries by the sackload : run with the mosquitoes : get lost : then found :: tapioca fail : add corn and water : delish :: the bassline of billie jean
