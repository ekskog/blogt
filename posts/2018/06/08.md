Title: VETERANS
  
109819 should mean something : but what? because finns are addicted to death metal : give me oysters or bananas : like when you are ruffled up : all up and running on a cube : give it a go on an udf : izzily : move towards the opposite direction : or the hammock : karnak the avatar reemergence : then a coffee with slovaqs : with an extension to table for five at the greek ice cream joint : gaggan man-handled : golden ants as lemongrass and mumba vomit : followed by a drive to nineties hiptyhop with a lesson
