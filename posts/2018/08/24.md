Title: GREEKS MOONDANCING
  
a simple win : when the bleam was a draw : reality sometimes is better :: all the tourists clogging the bike lanes : still a decent sauna run : pool :: more bag towing : aegean den : trading in rocks and stones :: proper-ish bicycles : jacksonkos for salads : and free beach lounge sofas : where a descendant of helen brings smirnoff ice : to swedish people baking themselves silly :: until exploration of lambi beach : where the posh resorts lay : açai bowls : before painkillers :: the agora saxophonist : plays stan getz: tourist strip fish joint : for stufed calamari
