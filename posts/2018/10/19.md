Title: MERCURY REV
  
**little tractor tavern moles >>** wake up to finnish meeting :: pixelated japanese porn : kolmogrov as an idol :: a meaningless marketing show : followed by a dismal thirty minutes of useless incomprehensible garbage :: and free lunch : the shuttle to ninety two : to inject money back in the corporation :: the proposed usage of land : blocked turing street :: bloody luftwaffe online check in : so bike run : aerobically :: then collect the power and return the chinos :: the five five oh downtown :: one third of all nukes :: slow kitchen : heat gear and socks : all the street dwellers on third and pike : lonely souls : with lots of tales : and nobody to tell them to : dream of ali mohammed :: drops from the kingdom : dug by little moles : and marissa of course
