**commuters >>** before four : move to a different transport : understand binary :: while the oats cook : and the dandelions brew :: then meet greet eat : and assemble a tft : zico in boxes :: from hagen to larsen : to evade becoming cannon fodder : sell the houses : and move to oahu :: walk to the son of richard :: for goggles and ear plugs :: enter through the garage : lap swim : then açaí : chapecó style
