Title: WHERE THE RICH LIVES  
  
wheels on gravel : like a rooster : warp octets, rumbas : rivers of milk : brekkie original : the fan was broken : ah the biznizdivelopahs : the ay-eye adds four years for a pair of spectacles : surfaced : connected to 8883\ : ice running to the palace : three or four times lost : the silence of the voice prompts : telling left from right : siberian winds : the taste of the sunday servant : catching up with lithium carrie
